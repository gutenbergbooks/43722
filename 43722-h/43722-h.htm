<h2><a name="CHARLES_LAMB1" id="CHARLES_LAMB1">CHARLES LAMB.</a><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>To Charles Lamb shall be allotted&mdash;general
assent has already assigned
it to him, and we have no wish to
dispute his claim&mdash;a quiet, quaint
niche, apart to himself, in some odd
nook or corner in the great temple of
English literature. It shall be carved
from the solid oak, and decorated with
Gothic tracery; but where Madonnas
and angels ordinarily appear, there
shall be all manner of laughing cherubs&mdash;one
amongst them disguised as a
chimney-<i>sweep</i>&mdash;with abundance of
sly and humorous devices. Some such
niches or stalls may occasionally be
seen in old cathedrals, sharing the
eternity of the structure, and drawing
the peculiar regard of the curious and
loitering visitor. You are startled to
find a merry device, and a wit by no
means too reverential, side by side
with the ideal forms of Catholic piety.
You approach to examine the solemn-looking
carving, and find, perhaps, a
fox clothed in priestly raiment&mdash;teaching,
in his own way, divers lessons of
morality to the bears and geese. Such
venerable and Gothic drollery suspends
for a moment, but hardly mars,
the serious and sedate feelings which
the rest of the structure, and the other
sculptured figures of the place, are
designed to excite.</p>

<p>Some such peculiar place amongst
our literary worthies seems, as we
have said, to be assigned by general
consent to Charles Lamb, nor are we
about to gainsay his right to this
position. He has all the genius that
could comport with oddity, and all
the oddity that could amalgamate with
genius. With a range of thought
most singularly contracted, considering
the times in which he lived, and
the men by whom he was surrounded,
he has contrived, by a charming
subtlety of observation, and a most
felicitous humour, to make us in love
even with that contractedness itself,
which in another would be despised,
as evidencing a sluggishness and obtuseness
of mind. Perhaps there are
few writers who could be named, of
these later days, on whose peculiar
merits there is so little difference of
opinion. As a poet, he was, at all
events, inoffensive, and his mediocrity
has been pardoned him in favour of
that genius he displayed as the humorous
and critical essayist. The
publication of his letters, too, has
materially added to his reputation,
and confirmed him as a favourite with
all to whom his lambent and playful
wit had already made him known and
esteemed. We are not aware, therefore,
that we have anything to dispute,
or essentially to modify, in the verdict
passed by popular opinion on this
writer. Yet something may remain
to be said to assist in appreciating and
discriminating his peculiar merits as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>a humorist&mdash;something to point out
where praise is due, and something to
draw the limits of that praise. Moreover,
his biography, as presented to
us by Mr Talfourd, claims some notice;
disclosing, as it does, one of the
saddest tragedies, and one of the
noblest acts of heroism, which ever
afflicted and dignified the life of a man
of letters. This biography is also
written by one who is himself distinguished
in the literary world, who
was an intimate friend of Lamb, and
personally acquainted with those literary
characters by whom Lamb had
surrounded himself, and who are here
grouped around him. Upon the whole,
therefore, the <i>Life and Writings of
Elia</i>, though a subject which no longer
wears the gloss of novelty, still invites
and may repay attention.</p>

<p>We hardly know whether to regret
it as a disadvantage to us, on the
present occasion, that we never enjoyed
the slightest acquaintance with
Charles Lamb, or indeed with any of
those literary friends amongst whom
he lived. We never saw this bland
humorist; we never heard that half-provoking,
half-pleasing stutter, which
awakened anticipation whilst it delayed
enjoyment, and added zest to
the witticism which it threatened to
mar, and which it had held back, for
a moment, only to project with the
happier impetus. We never had before
us, in bodily presence, that slight,
black-coated figure, and those antique
and curiously-gaitered legs, which, we
have also been assured, contributed
their part to the irresistible effect of
his kindly humour. We never even
knew those who had seen and talked
with him. To us he is a purely historic
figure. So, too, of his biographer&mdash;which
argues ourselves to be sadly
unknown&mdash;we have no other knowledge
than what runs about bruited in
the world; even his displays of eloquence,
forensic or parliamentary, we
have never had an opportunity of
hearing; we know him only by his
writings, and by that title we have
often heard bestowed on him, the
amiable author of <i>Ion</i>;&mdash;to which
amiability we refer, because to this
we must attribute, we suppose, a large
portion of that too laudatory criticism
which, in these volumes, he bestows
so lavishly and diffusely. We cannot,
therefore, bring to our subject any of
those vivid reminiscences, anecdotes,
or details which personal acquaintance
supplies. But, on the other hand, we
have no bias whatever to contend
against, whether of a friendly or hostile
description, in respect of any of
the literary characters whom we may
have occasion to speak of. Had they
all lived in the reign of good Queen
Anne, they could not have been more
remote from our personal sympathies
or antipathies.</p>

<p>It is probably known to most of
our readers that when, shortly after
the decease of Charles Lamb, his
letters were given to the world with
some biographical notices, there were
circumstances which imposed silence
on certain passages of his life, and
which obliged the editor to withhold
a certain portion of the letters. That
sister, in fact, was still alive whose
lamentable history was so intimately
blended with the career of Lamb, and
an allusion to her unfortunate tragedy
would have been cruel in any one, and
in an intimate friend utterly impossible.
Serjeant Talfourd had no other
course than to leave the gap or hiatus
in the biography, and cover it up and
conceal it as well as might be, from
the eyes of such readers as were not
better informed from other sources.
Upon the decease of that sister, there
no longer existed any motive for this
silence; and, indeed, shortly after
this event, the whole narrative was
revealed by a writer in the <i>British
Quarterly Review</i>, who had himself
waited till then before he permitted
himself to disclose it, and by its disclosure
do an act of justice to the
moral character of Lamb. Mr Talfourd
was, therefore, called upon to
complete his biographical notice, and
also the publication of the letters.
This he did in the two volumes entitled
<i>Final Memorials</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As a separate and subsidiary publication
became inevitable, and as probably
the exigencies of <i>the trade</i> required
that it should be of a certain
bulk and substance, we suppose we
must rather commiserate Mr Talfourd
than cast any blame upon him
for the manifest difficulty he has had
to fill these two volumes of <i>Final
Memorials</i>. One of them would have
been sufficient for all that he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
communicate, or that it was wise to
add. Many of the letters of Lamb
here printed are such as he had very
properly laid aside, in the first instance,
not because they trenched upon
too delicate ground, but because they
were wholly uninteresting. He had
very correctly said, in what, for distinction's
sake, we will call <i>The Life</i>&mdash;"I
have thought it better to omit
much of this verbal criticism, which,
not very interesting in itself, is unintelligible
without a contemporary
reference to the poems which are its
subject."&mdash;(P. 12.) Now we cannot,
of course, undertake to say that the
letters given us here are precisely
those which he speaks of as being
wisely rejected on the former occasion,
but we know that there was the
same good reason for this rejection,
for they are occupied with a verbal
criticism utterly uninteresting. Surely,
what neither illustrates a man's life,
nor adds a tittle to his literary reputation,
ought not to be allowed to
encumber for ever, as with a dead
weight, the collected works of an
author. The mischief is, that, if materials
of this kind are once published,
every succeeding editor finds it incumbent
on him to reprint them, lest
his edition should be thought less
perfect than others, and thus there is
no getting rid of the useless and burdensome
increment. It is otherwise
with another portion of these two
volumes, the sketches of the contemporaries
and friends of Lamb, which
Mr Serjeant Talfourd, or any future
editor, can either retrench, omit, or
enlarge, at his option.</p>

<p>In the next edition that is published
of the works of Lamb, we hope the
editor may be persuaded altogether
to recast his materials. The biography
should be kept apart, and not
interspersed piecemeal amongst the
letters. This is an arrangement, the
most provoking and irritating to the
reader that could have been devised.
Let us have all the biography at once,
and then sit down and enjoy the
letters of Lamb. Why be incessantly
bandied from the one to the other?
Few of the letters need any explanation;
if they do, the briefest note at
the head or at the foot would be sufficient.
Not to add, that, if it is wished
to refer to any event in the biography,
one does not know where to look for
it. And, <i>apropos</i> of this matter of
reference, it may be just worth mentioning
that the present volume is so
divided into <i>Parts</i>, and the parts so
paged, that any reference to a passage
by the number of the page is almost
useless. The numbers recommence
some half-dozen times in the course
of the volume; so that if you are
referred to page 50, you may find five
of them&mdash;you may find page 50 five
times over before you come to the
right one. For which reason we shall
dispense ourselves, in respect to this
volume, with our usual punctuality of
reference, for the reference must be
laboriously minute, and even then
will impose a troublesome search. In
the mere and humble task of editing,
the Serjeant has been by no means
fortunate.</p>

<p>Lying about in such confusion as
the fractions of the biography do at
present, we shall perhaps be rendering
a slight service if we bring together
from the two different publications
the leading events of the life of Lamb.</p>

<p>"Charles Lamb," says the first
publication, "was born on the 18th
February 1775, in Crown-office Row,
in the Inner Temple, where he spent
the first seven years of his life." At
the age of seven he was presented to
the school of Christ's Hospital, and
there remained till his fifteenth year.
His sweetness of disposition rendered
him a general favourite. From one
of his schoolfellows we have the following
account of him:&mdash;"Lamb,"
says Mr Le Grice, "was an amiable,
gentle boy, very sensible, and keenly
observing, indulged by his schoolfellows
and by his master, on account
of his infirmity of speech. His countenance
was mild; his complexion
clear brown, with an expression which
might lead you to think that he was of
Jewish descent. His eyes were not
each of the same colour&mdash;one was
hazel, the other had specks of gray
in the iris, mingled as we see red
spots in the bloodstone. His step was
<i>plantigrade</i>, (Mr Le Grice must be a
zoologist&mdash;Lamb would have smiled
to hear himself so scientifically described,)
which made his walk slow
and peculiar, adding to the staid appearance
of his figure. I never heard
his name mentioned without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
addition of Charles, although, as there
was no other boy of the name of
Lamb, the addition was unnecessary;
but there was an implied kindness in
it, and it was a proof that his gentle
manner excited that kindness." Mr
Le Grice adds that, in the sketch Lamb
gave in his <i>Recollections of Christ's
Hospital</i>, he drew a faithful portrait of
himself. "While others were all fire
and play, he stole along with all the
self-concentration of a young monk."
He had, in fact, only passed from
cloister to cloister, and, during the
holidays, it was in the Temple that he
found his home and his only place of
recreation. This cloistering-in of his
mind was the early and constant
peculiarity of his life. He would have
made an excellent monk; in those
good old times, be it understood, when
it was thought no great scandal if
there was a well-supplied cellarage
underneath the cloister.</p>

<p>After quitting Christ's Hospital, he
was employed for some time in the
South Sea House, but on the 5th April
1792 obtained that appointment in the
accountant's office in the East India
Company which was his stay and
support, in more senses than one,
through life.</p>

<p>A little anecdote is here introduced,
which strikes us as very characteristic.
It reveals the humorist, ready to
appreciate and promote a jest even at
his own expense, and at the easy
sacrifice of his own dignity or self-respect:
but it reveals something
more and sadder; it seems to betray a
broken, melancholy spirit, that was no
longer disposed to contend for its claim
to respect from others. "In the first
year of his clerkship," says Mr Le
Grice, "Lamb spent the evening of
the 5th November with some of his
former schoolfellows, who, being
amused with the particularly large and
flapping brim of his round hat, pinned
it up on the sides in the form of a
cocked hat. Lamb made no alteration
in it, but walked home in his usual
sauntering gait towards the Temple.
As he was going down Ludgate Hill,
some gay young men, who seemed
not to have passed the London Tavern
without resting, exclaimed, 'The
veritable Guy!&mdash;no man of straw!'
and with this exclamation they took
him up, making a chair with their
arms, carried him, seated him on a
post in St Paul's Churchyard, and
there left him. This story Lamb told
so seriously, that the truth of it was
never doubted. He wore his three-cornered
hat many evenings, and retained
the name of Guy ever after.
Like Nym, he quietly sympathised in
the fun, and seemed to say 'that was
the humour of it.'" Some one may
suggest that probably Lamb was himself
in the same condition, on this 5th
of November, as the young men "who
had not passed the London Tavern
without resting," and that therefore all
peculiar significance of the anecdote,
as it bears upon his character and disposition,
is entirely lost. But Lamb
relates the story himself, and afterwards,
and when there is no question
of sobriety, quietly acquiesces and
participates in the absurd joke played
upon himself.</p>

<p>At this time his most constant companion
was one <i>Jem</i> White, who wrote
some imaginary "Letters of John
Falstaff." These letters Lamb went
about all his life praising, and causing
others to praise, but seems never to
have found any one to share his
admiration. As even Mr Talfourd
has not a good word to throw away
upon the literary merits of Jem White,
we may safely conclude that Lamb's
friendship had in this instance quite
overruled his critical judgment.</p>

<p>But the associate and friend who
really exercised a permanent and
formative influence upon his mind,
was a man of a very different stamp&mdash;Samuel
Taylor Coleridge. They
had been schoolfellows at Christ's
Hospital, and, though no particular
intimacy existed at that time, the
circumstance formed a foundation for
a future friendship. "While Coleridge,"
writes Mr Talfourd, "remained
at the university, they met occasionally
on his visits to London; and
when he quitted it and came to town,
full of mantling hopes and glorious
schemes, Lamb became his admiring
disciple. The scene of these happy
meetings was a little public-house,
called the <i>Salutation and Cat</i>, in the
neighbourhood of Smithfield, where
they used to sup, and remain long
after they had 'heard the chimes at
midnight.'"</p>

<p>These suppers at the Salutation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Cat, in Smithfield, seem to carry back
the imagination far beyond the period
here alluded to; they seem to transport
us to the times of Oliver Goldsmith,
or to take us across the water
into Germany, where poetry and
philosophy may still occasionally find
refuge in the beer-shop. They were
always remembered by Lamb as the
brightest spots of his life. "I think
I hear you again," he says, writing to
Coleridge. "I imagine to myself the
little smoky room at the Salutation
and Cat, where we sat together through
the winter nights, beguiling the cares
of life with poetry." And in another
place he alludes to "those old suppers
at our old inn&mdash;when life was fresh
and topics exhaustless&mdash;and you first
kindled in me, if not the power, yet
the love of poetry, and beauty, and
kindliness." It was in these interviews
that the project was started, we
believe, of publishing a volume of
poems, the joint production of the two
friends.</p>

<p>But this pleasing project, and all
the poetry of life, was for a time to
give place, in the history of Lamb, to
a domestic tragedy of the most afflicting
nature. It is here that the Final
Memorials take up the thread of the
biography. It was on the 22d
September 1796, that the terrible
event took place which cast so perpetual
a shade, and reflected also so
constant an honour, on the life of
Lamb. He was living at this time
with his father, mother, and sister,
in lodgings in Little Queen Street,
Holborn. After being engaged in his
taskwork at the India House, he
returned in the evening to amuse his
father by playing cribbage. The old
man had sunk into dotage and the
miserable selfishness that so often
attends on old age. If his son wished
to discontinue for a time the game at
cribbage, and turn to some other
avocation, or the writing of a letter,
he would pettishly exclaim,&mdash;"If you
don't play cribbage, I don't see the use
of your coming home at all." The
mother also was an invalid, and Miss
Lamb, we are told, was worn down
to a state of extreme nervous misery,
by attention to needlework by day,
and to her mother by night, until the
insanity which had been manifested
more than once broke out into frenzy.
"It appeared," says the account extracted
from the <i>Times</i>, (an account
of the inquest, in which the names of
the parties are suppressed,) "that
while the family were preparing for
dinner, the young lady seized a case-knife
lying on the table, and in a
menacing manner pursued a little girl,
her apprentice, round the room. On
the calls of her infirm mother to forbear,
she renounced her first object,
and with loud shrieks approached her
parent. The child by her cries quickly
brought up the landlord of the house,
but too late. The dreadful scene presented
to him the mother lifeless,
pierced to the heart, on a chair, her
daughter yet wildly standing over her
with the fatal knife, and the old man,
her father, weeping by her side, himself
bleeding at the forehead from the
effects of a severe blow he received
from one of the forks she had been
madly hurling about the room."</p>

<p>The following is the letter which
Lamb wrote to Coleridge shortly after
the event. From this it appears that
it was he, and not the landlord, who
took the knife from the hand of the
lunatic.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;White,
or some of my friends, or the public
papers, by <i>this</i> time may have informed
you of the terrible calamities
that have fallen on our family. I
will only give you the outlines. My
poor, dear, dearest sister, in a fit of
insanity, has been the death of her
own mother. I was at hand only
time enough to snatch the knife out
of her grasp. She is at present in a
madhouse, from whence I fear she
must be removed to an hospital. God
has preserved to me my senses. I
eat, and drink, and sleep, and have
my judgment, I believe, very sound.
My poor father was slightly wounded,
and I am left to take care of him and
my aunt. Mr Norris of the Blue-coat
School has been very kind to us, and
we have no other friend; but, thank
God, I am very calm and composed,
and able to do the best that remains to
do. Write as religious a letter as
possible, but no mention of what is
gone and done with. With me 'the
former things are passed away,' and I
have something more to do than to feel.</p>

<p>"God Almighty have us all in his
keeping!&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></span></p>

<p>"Mention nothing of poetry; I have
destroyed every vestige of past vanities
of that kind. Do as you please;
but if you publish, publish mine (I
give free leave) without name or
initial, and never send me a book, I
charge you.</p>

<p>"Your own judgment will convince
you not to take any notice of this yet
to your dear wife. You look after
your family&mdash;I have my reason and
strength left to take care of mine. I
charge you, don't think of coming to
see me&mdash;write. I will not see you if
you come. God Almighty love you,
and all of us."&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span></p>

<p>Miss Lamb was of course placed in
an asylum, where, however, she was
in a short time restored to reason.
And now occurred the act of life-long
heroism on the part of the brother.
As soon as she was recovered, he
petitioned the authorities to resign
her to his care; he pledged himself to
be her guardian, her provider, her
<i>keeper</i>, for all her days to come. He
was at that time paying his addresses
to a young lady, with what hopes, or
with what degree of ardour, we are
not informed. But marriage with
her, or with any other, was now to
be entirely renounced. He devoted
his life, and all his love, to his unhappy
sister, and to the last he fulfilled
the obligation he had taken upon
himself without a murmur, and without
the least diminution of affection
towards the object of it.</p>

<p>We have called it an act of heroism;
we applaud it, and rejoice that it
stands upon record a complete and
accomplished act. There it stands,
not only to relieve the character of
Lamb from such littleness as it may
have contracted from certain habits of
intemperance, (of which perhaps more
has been said than was necessary;)
but it remains there as an enduring
memorial, prompting, to all time, to
the like acts of self-denying kindness,
and unshaken generosity of purpose.
But, admiring the act as we do, we
must still be permitted to observe,
that there was a degree of imprudence
in it which fully justified other
members of the family in their endeavours
to dissuade Lamb from his resolution,
and which would have justified
the authorities (whoever they were&mdash;and
about this matter there seems a
singular obscurity, and a suspicion is
created that even in proceedings of
this nature much is done carelessly,
informally, uncertainly) in refusing to
accede to his request. Miss Lamb
had several relapses into temporary
derangement; and, although she never
committed, as far as we are informed,
any acts of violence, this calmness of
behaviour, in her seasons of mental
aberration, could not have been calculated
on. We confess we should
have shrunk from the responsibility
of advising the generous but perilous
course which was adopted with so
fortunate a result.</p>

<p>How sad and fearful a charge
Lamb had entailed upon himself, let
the following extract suffice to show.
The subject is too painful to be longer
dwelt upon than is necessary. "The
constant impendency of this great
sorrow saddened to 'the Lambs' even
their holidays, as the journey which
they both regarded as the relief and
charm of the year was frequently followed
by a seizure; and, <i>when they
ventured to take it, a strait-waistcoat,
carefully packed up by Miss Lamb herself,
was their constant companion</i>.
Sad experience at last induced the
abandonment of the annual excursion,
and Lamb was contented with
walks in and near London during the
interval of labour. Miss Lamb experienced,
and full well understood, premonitory
symptoms of the attack, in
restlessness, low fever, and the inability
to sleep; and, as gently as possible,
prepared her brother for the
duty he must soon perform; and thus,
unless he could stave off the terrible
separation till Sunday, obliged him to
ask leave of absence from the office as
if for a day's pleasure&mdash;a bitter
mockery! On one occasion Mr
Charles Lloyd met them slowly
pacing together a little footpath in
Haxton Fields, <i>both weeping bitterly,
and found, on joining them, that they
were taking their solemn way to the
accustomed asylum</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It seems that a tendency to lunacy
was hereditary in the family, and
Charles Lamb himself had been for a
short period deprived of his reason.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>On this subject Mr Talfourd makes
the following excellent remark:&mdash;"The
wonder is, that, amidst all the
difficulties, the sorrows, and the excitements
of his succeeding forty
years, the malady never recurred.
Perhaps the true cause of this remarkable
exemption&mdash;an exemption the
more remarkable when his afflictions
are considered in association with one
single frailty&mdash;will be found in the
sudden claim made on his moral and
intellectual nature by a terrible exigency,
and by his generous answer to
that claim; <i>so that a life of self-sacrifice
was rewarded by the preservation
of unclouded reason</i>."</p>

<p>We will not weaken so admirable a
remark by repeating it in a worse
phraseology of our own. We wish
the Serjeant always wrote in the
same clear, forcible, and unaffected
manner. With respect to this seizure
which Lamb, in an early part of his
life, had experienced, there is a reference
in one of his letters too curious
to pass unnoticed. Writing to
Coleridge, he says&mdash;"At some future
time I will amuse you with an account,
as full as my memory will permit,
of the strange turns my frenzy
took. I look back upon it at times
with a gloomy kind of envy, for,
while it lasted, I had many, many hours
of pure happiness. Dream not, Coleridge,
of having tasted all the grandeur
and wildness of fancy till you
have gone mad! All now seems to
me vapid, or comparatively so."</p>

<p>The residue of Lamb's life is uneventful.
The publication of a book&mdash;a
journey into Cumberland&mdash;his
final liberation from office, are the
chief incidents. These it is not necessary
to arrange in chronological
order: they can be alluded to as occasion
requires. But we will pursue a
little further our notice of Mr Talfourd's
biographical labours, that we
may clear our way as we proceed.</p>

<p>We have seen that Lamb, in the
first agony of his grief, rudely threw
aside his poetry, and his scheme of
publishing conjointly with Coleridge.
Poetry and schemes of publication
are not, however, so easily dismissed.
As his mind subsided into a calmer
state, they were naturally resumed.
The literary partnership was extended,
and Lloyd was admitted to
associate his labours in the forthcoming
volume. "At length," says Mr
Talfourd, "the small volume containing
the poems of Coleridge, Lloyd,
and Lamb, was published by Mr
Cottle at Bristol. It excited little
attention." We do not wonder at
this, if the lucubrations of Mr Lloyd
had any conspicuous place in the volume.
How the other two poets&mdash;how
Coleridge especially, could have consented
to this literary partnership, with
so singularly inept and absurd a writer,
would be past explaining, if it were
not for some hint that we receive that
Charles Lloyd was the son of a wealthy
banker, and might, therefore, be the
fittest person to transact that part of
the business which occurs between the
author and the publisher. Here we
have a striking instance of Mr Talfourd's
misplaced amiability of criticism.
"Lloyd," he says, "wrote
<i>pleasing</i> verses, and with great facility&mdash;a
facility fatal to excellence; but
his mind was chiefly remarkable for
<i>the fine power of analysis which distinguishes
his 'London,'</i> and other of
his later compositions. In this power
of discriminating and distinguishing&mdash;carried
to a pitch almost of painfulness&mdash;Lloyd
has scarcely been
equalled; and his poems, though rugged
in point of versification, will be
found, by those who will read them
with the calm attention they require,
replete with critical and moral suggestions
of the highest value." Very
grateful to Mr Serjeant Talfourd will
any reader feel who shall be induced,
by his recommendation, to peruse, or
attempt to peruse, Mr Lloyd's poem
of "London!" We were. "Fine
power of analysis!" Why, it is one
stream of mud&mdash;of theologic mud.
"Rugged in point of versification!"
There is no trace of verse, and the
style is an outlandish garb, such as
no man has ever seen elsewhere,
either in prose or verse. Poor Lloyd
was a lunatic patient!&mdash;on him no one
would be severe; but why should an
intelligent Serjeant, unless prompted
by a sly malice against all mankind,
persuade us to read his execrable
stuff? The following is a fair specimen
of the drug, and is, indeed, taken
as the book opened. We add the two
last lines of the preceding stanza, to
give all possible help to the elucida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>tion
of the one we quote. The italics
are all Mr Lloyd's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you affirm <i>grace irresistible</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must deny all liberty of will.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>142.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But you reply, grace irresistible<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our creed admits not. I am sorry for't.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough, or not enough, to bind the free will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grace must be. Not enough? The dose falls short.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is of <i>cause</i> the prime condition still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That it be <i>operative</i>. Yet divines exhort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Us to deem grace <i>sole source</i> of all salvation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if we're damned, blame <i>but its application</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But divinity of this kind, it may be
said, though well calculated to display
"the power of discriminating and distinguishing,
carried to a pitch almost
of painfulness," is not exactly favourable
to flowing verse. Here is a specimen
where a lady is the subject,
and the verse should be smooth then,
if ever.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I well remember her years, five-and-twenty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Ah! now my muse is got into a gallop,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longer perhaps! But time sufficient, plenty<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of treasured offices of love to call up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was then, as I recollect, quite dainty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And delicate, and seemed a fair envelope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of virgin sweetness and angelic goodness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fate should treat her with such reckless rudeness!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poor man seems to have had
not the least appreciation of the
power of language, so as to distinguish
between the ludicrous and the
pathetic. He must have read "Hudibras"
with tears, <i>not</i> of laughter,
in his eyes, and hence drawn his
notion of tenderness of diction as well
as harmony of verse. The most surprising
thing about Lloyd is, that
such a man should have chosen for
his literary task to translate&mdash;Alfieri!
And although he has performed the
task very far from well, he has accomplished
it in a manner that could not
have been anticipated from his original
compositions.</p>

<p>After this specimen of Mr Talfourd's
laudatory criticism, we need not be
astonished at any amount of eulogy
he bestows on such names as Hazlitt
and others, which really have a certain
claim on the respect of all men.
And yet, even after this, we felt
some slight surprise at hearing Mr
Talfourd speak of "the splendid reputation"
of Mr Harrison Ainsworth!
Would Mr Talfourd <i>have</i> such a reputation,
if it were offered him? Would he
not rather have remained in complete
obscurity than be distinguished by such
"splendours" as the authorship of
<i>Jack Sheppard</i> would have invested
him with? Why should he throw about
this indiscriminate praise, and make
his good word of no possible value?
Splendid reputation! Can trash be
anything but trash, because a multitude
of the idle and the ignorant,
whom it exactly suits, read and admire?
By-and-by they grow ashamed
of their idol, when they find they have
him all to themselves, and that sensible
people are smiling at their enthusiasm;
they then discard him for
some new, untried, and <i>unconvicted</i>
favourite. Such is the natural history
of these splendid reputations.</p>

<p>The second volume of the "Final
Memorials" is in great part occupied
with sketches of the literary
friends and companions of Lamb.
These Mr Talfourd introduces by a
somewhat bold parallel between the
banquets at the lordly halls of Holland
House and the suppers in the dark and
elevated chambers in the Inner Temple,
whither Lamb had removed.
We are by no means scandalised at
such a comparison. Wit may flow,
and wisdom too, as freely in the garret
as in the saloon. To eat off plate,
to be served assiduously by liveried
attendants, may not give any more
real zest to colloquial pleasure, to
good hearty talking, than to attack
without ceremony "the cold beef
flanked with heaps of smoking potatoes,
which Becky has just brought
in." Nor do we know that claret in
the flagon of beautifully cut glass,
may be a more potent inspiration of
wit than "the foaming pots of porter
from the best tap in Fleet Street."
We are not at all astonished that such
a parallel should be drawn; what surprises
us is, that, being in the humour
to draw such comparisons, the Sergeant
could find only <i>one</i> place in all
London which could be brought into
this species of contrast, and of rivalry,
with Holland House. "Two circles
of rare social enjoyment, differing as
widely as possible in all external circumstances&mdash;<i>but
each superior in its
kind to all others</i>, were at the same time
generously opened to men of letters."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
We, who have been admitted to neither,
have perhaps no right to an opinion;
but, judging by the bill of fare presented
to us, we shrewdly suspect
there were very many circles where
we should have preferred the intellectual
repast to that set out in Inner
Temple Lane. We doubt not the
Serjeant himself has assembled round
his own table a society that we should
greatly more have coveted the pleasure
of joining. We have the name
of Godwin, it is true, but Godwin
never opened his mouth;&mdash;played whist
all the evening. Had he not written
his book? why should he talk? We
have Hazlitt,&mdash;but by all accounts he
was rarely in a tolerable humour,
perpetually raving, with admirable
consistency, in praise of republics and
Bonaparte. Coleridge was too rarely
a visitor to be counted in the list; and
certain we are that we should have no
delight in hearing Charles Lloyd
"reason of fate, free-will, foreknowledge
absolute," to Leigh Hunt.
Some actors are named, of whose
conversational powers we know nothing,
and presume nothing very extraordinary.
Lamb's "burly jovial
brother, the Ajax Telamon of clerks,"
and a Captain Burney, of whom we
are elsewhere told that he liked
Shakspeare "because he was so
much of a gentleman," promise little
on the score of intellectual conversation;
neither should we be particularly
anxious to sit opposite a certain
M. B., of whom Lamb said, "M., if
dirt were trumps, what hands you
would hold!"</p>

<p>After this singular parallel, we are
shown round a gallery of portraits.
First we have George Dyer, who appears
to be the counterpart of our old
friend Dominie Sampson. But, indeed,
we hold George Dyer to be a
sort of myth, a fabulous person, the
creation of Charles Lamb's imagination,
and imposed as a reality on his
friends. Such an absurdity as he is
here represented to be could not have
been bred, could not have existed, in
these times, and in London. If we
are to credit the stories told of him,
his walking in broad day into the
canal at Islington was one of the
wisest things he did, or could possibly
have done. Lamb tells him, in the
strictest confidence, that the "Waverley
Novels" are the works of
Lord Castlereagh, just returned from
the Congress of Sovereigns at Vienna!
Off he runs, nor stops till he reaches
Maida Hill, where he deposits his
news in the ears of Leigh Hunt, who,
"as a public man," he thinks ought
to be possessed of the great fact. At
another time Lamb gravely inquires
of him, "Whether it was true, as was
commonly reported, that he was to be
made a lord?" "Oh dear, no! Mr
Lamb," he responds with great earnestness,
"I could not think of such a
thing: it is not true, I assure you."
"I thought not," replies the wit,
"and I contradict it wherever I go;
but the government will not ask your
consent&mdash;they may raise you to the
peerage without your even knowing
it." "I hope not, Mr Lamb; indeed,
indeed, I hope not; it would not suit
me at all," repeats our modern Dominie,
and goes away musing on the
possibility of strange honours descending,
whether he will or not, upon his
brow. It goes to our heart to disturb
a good story, but such a man as the
George Dyer here represented never
could have existed.</p>

<p>We have rather a long account of
Godwin, with some remarks not very
satisfactory upon his intellectual character.
That Mr Godwin was taciturn,
that he conversed, when he did talk,
upon trivial subjects, and in a small
precise manner, and that he was especially
fond of sleeping after dinner&mdash;all
this we can easily understand. Mr
Godwin's mental activity was absorbed
in his authorship, and he was a very
voluminous author. But we cannot
so easily understand Mr Talfourd's
explanations, nor why these habits
should have any peculiar connexion
with the intellectual qualities of the
author of <i>Caleb Williams</i>, and a host
of novels, as well as of the <i>Political
Justice</i>, of the <i>Life of Chaucer</i>, and the
<i>History of the Commonwealth</i>. Such
habits are rather the result of a man's
temperament, and the manner of life
which circumstances have thrown him
into, than of his intellectual powers.
Profound metaphysicians have been
very vivacious talkers, and light and
humorous writers very taciturn men.
Mr Talfourd finds that Godwin had
no imagination, was all abstract
reason, and thus accounts for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
having no desire to address his fellowmen
but through the press. The passage
is too long to quote, and would
be very tedious. We must leave him
in quiet possession of his own theory
of the matter.</p>

<p>It was new to us, and may be to
our readers, to hear that Godwin
supported himself "by a shop in
Skinner Street, where, under the
auspices of 'Mr J. Godwin &amp; Co.,'
the prettiest and wisest books for
children issued, which old-fashioned
parents presented to their children,
without suspecting that the graceful
lessons of piety and goodness which
charmed away the selfishness of
infancy, were published, and sometimes
revised, and now and then
written, by a philosopher whom they
would scarcely venture to name!"
We admire the good sense which
induced him to adhere to so humble
an occupation, if he found it needful
for his support. But what follows is
not quite so admirable. He was a
great borrower; or, in the phrase of
Mr Talfourd, "he met the exigencies
of business with the trusting simplicity
which marked his course; he asked
his friends for aid without scruple,
considering that their means were
justly the due of one who toiled in
thought for their inward life, and had
little time to provide for his own outward
existence, and took their excuses
when offered without doubt or
offence." And then the Serjeant proceeds
to relate, in a tone of the most
touching simplicity, his own personal
experience upon this matter. "The
very next day after I had been
honoured and delighted by an introduction
to him at Lamb's chambers, I
was made still more proud and happy
by his appearance at my own on such
an errand, which my poverty, not my
will, rendered abortive. After some
pleasant chat on indifferent matters,
he carelessly observed that he had a
little bill for &pound;150 falling due on the
morrow, <i>which he had forgotten till
that morning</i>, and desired the loan of
the necessary amount for a few weeks.
At first, in eager hopes of being able
thus to oblige one whom I regarded
with admiration akin to awe, I began
to consider whether it was possible
for me to raise such a sum; but, alas!
a moment's reflection sufficed to convince
me that the hope was vain, and I
was obliged, with much confusion,
to assure my distinguished visitor
how glad I should have been to serve
him, but that I was only just starting
as a special pleader, was obliged to
write for magazines to help me on,
and had not such a sum in the world.
'Oh dear!' said the philosopher, 'I
thought you were a young gentleman
of fortune&mdash;don't mention it, don't
mention it&mdash;I shall do very well elsewhere!'
And then, in the most gracious
manner, reverted to our former
topics, and sat in my small room for
half-an-hour, as if to convince me
that my want of fortune made no difference
in his esteem." How very
gracious! The most shameless borrower
coming to raise money from a
young gentleman of fortune, to meet
"a little bill which he had forgotten
till that morning," would hardly, on
finding his mistake, have made an
abrupt departure. He would have
coolly beat a retreat, as the philosopher
did. We never hear, by the way,
that he returned "to my small room"
at any other time, for half-an-hour's
chat. But how very interesting it is
to see the learned Serjeant, whose
briefs have made him acquainted with
every trick and turn of commercial
craft, retaining this sweet and pristine
simplicity!</p>

<p>The Serjeant, however, has a style
of narrative which, though on the surface
it displays the most good-natured
simplicity, slyly insinuates to the more
intelligent reader that he sees quite as
far as another, and is by no means
the dupe of his own amiability. Thus,
in his description of Coleridge, (which
would be too long a subject to enter
into minutely,) he has the following
passage, (perhaps the best in the description,)
which, while it seems to
echo to the full the unstinted applause
so common with the admirers of that
singular man, gives a quiet intimation
to the reader that he was not altogether
so blind as some of those admirers.
"If his entranced hearers
often were unable to perceive the
bearings of his argument&mdash;too mighty
for any grasp but his own&mdash;and sometimes
reaching beyond his own&mdash;they
understood 'a <i>beauty</i> in the words, if
not the words;' and a wisdom and a
piety in the illustrations, even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
unable to connect them with the idea
which he desired to illustrate." Mr
Talfourd reveals here, we suspect, the
true secret of the charm which
Coleridge exercised in conversation.
His hearers never seemed to have carried
away anything distinct or serviceable
from his long discourses.
They understood "a beauty in the
words, if not the words;" they felt a
charm like that of listening to music,
and, when the voice ceased, there was
perhaps as little distinct impression
left, as if it had really been a beautiful
symphony they had heard.</p>

<p>There is only one more in this gallery
of portraits before which we shall
pause, and that only for a moment,
to present a last specimen of the critical
manner of Mr Talfourd. We
are sorry the last should not be
the best; and yet, as this sketch is a
reprint, in an abridged form, of an
essay affixed to the <i>Literary Remains
of Hazlitt</i>, it may be considered as
having received a more than usual
share of the author's attention. It is
thus that he analyses the mental constitution
of one whom he appears to
have studied and greatly admired&mdash;William
Hazlitt. "He had as unquenchable
a desire for truth as others
have for wealth, or power, or fame:
he pursued it with sturdy singleness
of purpose, and enunciated it without
favour or fear. But besides that love
of truth, that sincerity in pursuing it,
and that boldness in telling it, he had
also a fervent aspiration after the beautiful,
a vivid sense of pleasure, and an
<i>intense consciousness of his own individual
being</i>, which sometimes produced
obstacles to the current of speculation,
by which it was broken into dazzling
eddies, or urged into devious windings.
Acute, fervid, vigorous as his
mind was, it wanted <i>the one great
central power of imagination, which
brings all the other faculties into harmonious
action, multiplies them into
each other, makes truth visible in the
forms of beauty, and substitutes intellectual
vision for proof</i>. Thus in him
truth and beauty held divided empire.
In him the spirit was willing but the
flesh was <i>strong</i>, and when these contend
it is not difficult to anticipate
the result; 'for the power of beauty
shall sooner transform honesty from
what it is into a bawd, than the person
of honesty shall transform beauty
into its likeness.' This 'sometime
paradox' was vividly exemplified in
Hazlitt's personal history, his conversation,
and his writings."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Are we to gather from this most
singular combination of words, that
Hazlitt had a grain too much of sensuality
in his composition, which diverted
him from the search after
truth? The expression, "the flesh
was strong," and the quotation so curiously
introduced from Shakspeare,
seem to point this way. And then,
again, are we to understand that this
too much of sensuality was owing to
a want of imagination?&mdash;that central
power of imagination which is here
described in a manner that no system
of metaphysics we have studied enables
us in the least to comprehend. We
know something of Schelling's "intellectual
intuition" transcending the
ordinary scope of reason. Is this
"intellectual vision, which the imagination
substitutes for proof," of the
same family? But indeed it would
be idle insincerity to ask such questions.
Sergeant Talfourd knows no
more than we do what it means.
The simple truth is, that here, as too
frequently elsewhere, he aims at a
certain subtlety of thought, and falls
unfortunately upon no thought whatever&mdash;upon
mere confusion of thought,
which he attempts to hide by a quantity
of somewhat faded phrase and
rhetorical diction.</p>

<p>If we refer to the original essay itself,
we shall not be aiding ourselves
or Mr Talfourd. The statement is
fuller, and the confusion greater. In
one point it relieves us&mdash;it relieves
us entirely from the necessity of too
deeply pondering the philosophic import
of any phraseology our critic
may adopt, for the phrase is changed
merely to please the ear; and what at
first has the air of definition proves to
be merely a poetic colouring. He
thus commences his essay: "As an
author, Mr Hazlitt may be contemplated
principally in three aspects&mdash;as
a moral and political reasoner, as
an observer of character and manners,
and as a critic in literature and paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ing.
It is in the first character only
that he should be followed with caution."
In the two others he is, of
course, to be followed implicitly. Why
he was not equally perfect as a moral
and political reasoner, Mr Talfourd
proceeds to explain. Mr Hazlitt had
"a passionate desire for truth," and
also "earnest aspirations for the beautiful."
Now, continues our critic,
"the vivid sense of beauty may, indeed,
have fit home in the breast of
the searcher after truth, but then he
must also be endowed with the highest
of all human faculties&mdash;the great mediatory
and interfusing power of imagination,
which presides supreme over
the mind, brings all its powers and
impulses into harmonious action, and
becomes itself the single organ of all.
At its touch, truth becomes visible in
the shape of beauty; the fairest of material
things become the living symbols
of airy thought, and the mind apprehends
<i>the finest affinities of the
world of sense and spirit 'in clear
dream and solemn vision.'</i>" This last
expression conveys, we presume, all
the meaning, or no-meaning, of the
phrase afterwards adopted&mdash;the "intellectual
vision which it substitutes
for truth." Both are mere jingle.
The rest of the passage is much the
same as it stands in the <i>Final Memorials</i>.
Somehow or other Mr Hazlitt
is proved to have been defective as a
reasoner, because he wanted imagination!&mdash;and
imagination was wanted,
not to enlarge his experience of mental
phenomena, but to step between
his love of truth and his sense of
beauty. Did he ever divulge this discovery
to his friend Hazlitt?&mdash;and how
did the metaphysician receive it?</p>

<p>To one so generous towards others,
it would be ungracious to use hard
words. Indeed, to leave before an
intelligent reader these specimens of
"fine analysis," and "powers of discriminating
and distinguishing," is quite
severe enough punishment. We wish
we could expunge them, with a host of
similar ones, not only from our record,
but from the works of the author himself.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is time that we turn from the
biography to the writings of Charles
Lamb&mdash;to Elia, the gentle humorist.
Not that Charles Lamb is exclusively
the humorist: far from it. His verse
is, at all events, sufficient to demonstrate
a poetic sensibility, and his
prose writings display a subtlety of
analysis and a delicacy of perception
which were not always enlisted in the
service of mirth, but which were often
displayed in some refined criticism, or
keen observation upon men and manners.
Still it is as a humorist that he
has chiefly attracted the attention of the
reading public, and obtained his
popularity and literary <i>status</i>. But
the coarser lineaments of the humorist
are not to be found in him. His
is a gentle, refined, and refining
humour, which never trespasses upon
delicacy; which does not excite that
common and almost brutal laughter,
so easily raised at what are called the
comic miseries of life&mdash;often no comedy
to those who have to endure them. It
is a humour which generally attains
its end by investing what is lowly
with an unexpected interest, not by
degrading what is noble by allying it
with mean and grotesque circumstance,
(the miserable art of parody;)
it is a humour, in short, which excites
our laughter, not by stifling all reflection,
but by awakening the mind to
new trains of thought, and prompting
to odd but kindly sympathies. It is a
humour which a poet might indulge in,
which a very nun might smile at,
which a Fenelon would at times prepare
himself mildly to admonish, but,
on seeing from how clear a spirit it
emanated, would, relaxing his brows
again, let pass unreproved.</p>

<p>There is a great rage at present
for the comic; and, to do justice to
our own times, we think it may be
said that wit was never more abundant&mdash;and
certainly the pencil was
never used with more genuine humour.
But we cannot sympathise with,
or much admire, that class of writers
who seem to make the comic their
exclusive study, who peer into everything
merely to find matter of jest in
it. Everything is no more comic than
everything is solemn, in this mingled
world of ours. These men, reversing
the puritanical extravagance, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><i>improve</i> every incident into the occasion
of a laugh. At length one extreme
becomes as tedious as the other.
We have, if we may trust to advertisements,
for we never saw the production
itself, a <i>Comic History of
England!</i> and, amongst other editions
of the learned commentator, <i>A Comic
Blackstone!</i> We shall be threatened
some day with a <i>Comic Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>;
or we shall have these comic
gentry following the track round the
whole world which Mrs Sommerville
has lately taken, in her charming
book on Physical Geography. They
will go hopping and grinning after
her, peeping down volcanoes, and
punning upon coral reefs, and finding
laughter in all things in this circumnavigable
globe. Well, let them go
grinning from pole to pole, and all
along the tropics. We can wish them
no worse punishment.</p>

<p>This exclusive cultivation of the
comic must sadly depress the organ
of veneration, and not at all foster
any refined feelings of humanity. To
him who is habitually in the mocking
vein, it matters little what the subject,
or who the sufferer, so that he
has his jest. It is marvellous the
utter recklessness to human feeling
these light laughers attain to. Their
seemingly sportive weapon, the "satiric
thong" they so gaily use, is in
harder hands than could be found
anywhere else out of Smithfield. Nor
is it quite idle to notice in what a
direct barefaced manner these jesters
appeal to the coarse untutored malice
of our nature. If we were to analyse
the jest, we should sometimes find
that we had been laughing just as
wisely as the little untaught urchin,
who cannot hold his sides for "fun,"
if some infirm old woman, slipping
upon the slide he has made, falls down
upon the pavement. The jest only
lasts while reflection is laid asleep.</p>

<p>In this, as we have already intimated,
lies the difference between the
crowd of jesters and Charles Lamb.
We quit their uproarious laughter for
his more quiet and pensive humour
with somewhat the same feeling that
we leave the noisy, though amusing,
highway, for the cool landscape and
the soft greensward. We reflect as
we smile; the malice of our nature is
rather laid to rest than called forth; a
kindly and forgiving temper is excited.
We rise from his works, if not with
any general truth more vividly impressed,
yet prepared, by gentle and
almost imperceptible touches, to be
more social in our companionships,
and warmer in our friendships.</p>

<p>Whether from mental indolence, or
from that strong partiality he contracted
towards familiar things, he
lived, for a man of education and intelligence,
in a singularly limited
circle of thought. In the stirring
times of the first French Revolution,
we find him abstracting himself from
the great drama before him, to bury
himself in the gossip of <i>Burnet's History</i>.
He writes to Manning&mdash;"I am
reading <i>Burnet's own Times</i>. Quite
the prattle of age, and outlived importance....
Burnet's good old
prattle I can bring present to my
mind; I can make the Revolution
present to me&mdash;the French Revolution,
by a converse perversity in my
nature, I fling as far <i>from</i> me."
Science appears never to have interested
him, and such topics as political
economy may well be supposed to have
been quite foreign to his nature. But
even as a reader of poetry, his taste, or
his partialities in his range of thought,
limited him within a narrow circuit. He
could make nothing of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>;
Shelley was an unknown region to
him, and the best of his productions
never excited his attention. To Byron
he was almost equally indifferent.
From these he could turn to study
George Withers! and find matter for
applause in lines which needed, indeed,
the recommendation of age to
give them the least interest. His personal
friendship for Wordsworth and
Coleridge led him here out of that
circle of old writers he delighted to
dwell amongst; otherwise, we verily
believe, he would have deserted them
for Daniell and Quarles. But perhaps,
to one of his mental constitution, it
required a certain concentration to
bring his powers into play; and we
may owe to this exclusiveness of taste
the admirable fragments of criticism
he has given us on Shakspeare and
the elder dramatists.</p>

<p>In forming our opinion, however, of
the tastes and acquirements of Lamb,
we must not forget that we are dealing
with a humorist, and that his tes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>timony
against himself cannot be
always taken literally. On some
occasions we shall find that he amused
himself and his friends by a merry
vein of self-disparagement; he would
delight to exaggerate some deficiency,
or perhaps some Cockney taste, in
which, perhaps, he differed from others
only in his boldness of avowal. He
had not, by all accounts, what is called
an ear for music; but we are not to
put faith in certain witty descriptions
he has given of his own obtuseness to
all melodious sounds. We find him,
in some of his letters, speaking of
Braham with all the enthusiasm of a
young haunter of operas. "I follow
him about," he says, "like a dog."
Nothing has given more scandal to
some of the gentle admirers of Lamb,
than to find him boldly avowing his
preference of Fleet Street to the
mountains of Cumberland. He claimed
no love for the picturesque. Shops,
and the throng of men, were not to be
deserted for lakes and waterfalls. It
was his to live in London, and,
as a place to <i>live in</i>, there was no
peculiarity of taste in preferring it to
Cumberland; but when he really paid
his visit to Coleridge at Keswick, he
felt the charm fully as much as tourists
who are accustomed to dwell,
rather too loudly, upon their raptures.
The letters he wrote, after this visit,
from some of which we will quote, if
our space permits us, describe very
naturally, unaffectedly, and vividly,
the impressions which are produced
on a first acquaintance with mountainous
scenery.</p>

<p>Indeed we may remark, that no
man can properly enter into the character
or the writings of a humorist,
who is not prepared both to permit
and to understand certain little departures
from truth. We mean, that
playing with the subject where our
<i>convictions</i> are not intended to be
seriously affected. Those who must
see everything as true or false, and
immediately approve or reject accordingly,
who know nothing of that
<i>punctum indifferens</i> on which the humorist,
for a moment, takes his stand,
had better leave him and his writings
entirely alone. "I like a smuggler,"
says Charles Lamb, in one of his
essays. Do you, thereupon, gravely
object that a smuggler, living in
constant violation of the laws of
the land, ought by no means to
be an object of partiality with any
respectable order-loving gentleman?
Or do you nod assent and acquiesce in
this approbation of the smuggler?
You do neither one nor the other.
You smile and read on. You know
very well that Lamb has no design
upon your serious convictions,
has no wish whatever that <i>you</i> should
like a smuggler; he merely gives expression
to a partiality of his own,
unreasonable if you will, but arising
from certain elements in the smuggler's
character, which just then are uppermost
in his mind. A great deal of
the art and tact of the humorist lies
in bringing out little truths, and
making them stand in the foreground,
where greater truths usually take up
their position. Thus, in one of Lamb's
papers, he would prove that a convalescent
was in a less enviable condition
than a man downright ill. This
is done by heightening the effect of
a subordinate set of circumstances,
and losing sight of facts of greater
importance. No error of judgment
can really be introduced by this sportive
ratiocination, this mock logic,
while it perhaps may be the means of
disclosing many ingenious and subtle
observations, to which, afterwards,
you may, if you will, assign their just
relative importance.</p>

<p>It would be a work of supererogation,
even if space allowed us, to go
critically over the whole writings of
Lamb&mdash;his poems, his essays, and his
letters. It is the last alone that
we shall venture to pause upon, or
from which we may hope to make any
extract not already familiar to the
reader. His poetry, indeed, cannot
claim much critical attention. It is possible,
here and there, to find an elegant
verse, or a beautiful expression; there
is a gentle, amiable, pleasing tone
throughout it; but, upon the whole, it is
without force, has nothing to recommend
it of deep thought or strong passion.
His tragedy of <i>John Woodville</i> is
a tame imitation of the manner of the
old dramatists&mdash;of their manner when
engaged in their subordinate and preparatory
scenes. For there is no
attempt at tragic passion. We read
the piece asking ourselves when the
play is to begin, and while still asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the question, find ourselves brought to
its conclusion. If the poems are read
by few, the <i>Essays of Elia</i> have
been perused by all. Who is not
familiar with what is now a historic
fact&mdash;the discovery of roast pig in
China? This, and many other touches
of humour, it would be useless here to
repeat. His letters, as being latest
published, seem alone to call for any
especial observations, and from these
we shall cull a few extracts to enliven
our own critical labours.</p>

<p>What first strikes a reader, on the
perusal of the letters, is their remarkable
similarity in style to the essays.
Some of them, indeed, were afterwards
converted into essays, and that
more by adding to them than altering
their structure. That style, which at
first seems extremely artificial, was,
in fact, natural in Lamb. He had
formed for himself a manner, chiefly
by the study of our classical essayists,
and of still older writers, from which
it would have been an effort in him to
depart. With whatever ease, therefore,
or rapidity, he may have written
his letters, it was impossible that they
should bear the impress of freedom.
His style was essentially a lettered
style, partaking little of the conversational
tone of his own day. They
could obtain the case of finished compositions,
not of genuine letters. For
this, if for no other reason, they can
never be brought into comparison with
those charming spontaneous effusions
of humour which flowed from Cowper,
in his letters to his old friend Hill, and
his cousin, Lady Hesketh. They are
charming productions, however, and
the best of his letters will take rank,
we think, with the best of his essays,
in the public estimation.</p>

<p>We must first quote from a letter to
Manning, after his visits to the lakes,
to rescue his character in the eyes of
the lovers of the picturesque from the
imputation of being utterly indifferent
to the higher beauties of nature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Coleridge received us with all the
hospitality in the world. He dwells
upon a small hill by the side of Keswick,
in a comfortable house, quite enveloped on
all sides by a net of mountains: great
floundering bears and monsters they
seemed, all couchant and asleep. We
got in in the evening, travelling in a post-chaise
from Penrith, in the midst of a
gorgeous sunshine, which transmuted all
the mountains into colours, purple, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. We thought we had got into fairyland.
But that went off (and it never
came again; while we stayed we had no
more fine sunsets), and we entered Coleridge's
comfortable study just in the
dusk, when the mountains were all dark
with clouds on their heads. Such an impression
I never received from objects of
sight before, nor do I suppose that I can
ever again. Glorious creatures, fine old
fellows&mdash;Skiddaw, &amp;c.&mdash;I never shall forget
ye, how ye lay about that night like
an entrenchment&mdash;gone to bed, as it
seemed for the night, but promising that
ye were to be seen in the morning....
We have clambered up to the top of
Skiddaw; and I have waded up the bed
of Lodore. In fine, I have satisfied myself
that there is such a thing as tourists
call <i>romantic</i>, which I very much suspected
before; they make such a sputtering
about it.... Oh! its fine black
head, and the bleak air atop of it, with
the prospects of mountains about and
about, making you giddy. It was a day
that will stand out like a mountain, I am
sure, in my life."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Mr Manning we are told little
or nothing, though he seems to have
been one of the very dearest friends
of Lamb. His best letters are written
to Manning&mdash;the drollest, and some
of the most affecting. The following
was written to dissuade him from
some scheme of oriental travel. Manning
was, at the time, at Paris:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"<i>Feb. 19, 1803.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Manning</span>,&mdash;The general
scope of your letter afforded no indications
of insanity; but some particular points
raised a scruple. For God's sake, don't
think any more of 'Independent Tartary.'
What are you to do among such Ethiopians?
Read Sir John Mandeville's
travels to cure you, or come over to
England. There is a Tartar-man now
exhibiting at Exeter Change. Come and
talk with him, and hear what he says
first. Indeed, he is no favourable specimen
of his countrymen! Some say they
are cannibals; and then conceive a Tartar
fellow <i>eating</i> my friend, and adding
the <i>cool malignity</i> of mustard and vinegar!
I am afraid 'tis the reading of
Chaucer has misled you; his foolish
stories about Cambuscan, and the ring and
the horse of brass. Believe me, there are
no such things. These are all tales&mdash;a
horse of brass never flew, and a king's
daughter never talked with birds. The
Tartars really are a cold, insipid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
smoutchy set. You'll be sadly moped
(if you are not eaten) amongst them.
Pray try and cure yourself. Shave yourself
oftener. Eat no saffron; for saffron
eaters contract a terrible Tartar-like
yellow. Shave <i>the upper lip</i>. Go about
like a European. Read no books of
voyages, (they are nothing but lies;) only
now and then a romance, to keep the
fancy <i>under</i>. Above all, don't go to any
sights of <i>wild beasts</i>. <i>That has been your
ruin.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>And when Manning really departed
on his voyage to China, he writes to
him in the following mingled strains
of humour and of feeling. Being
obliged to omit a great deal, it would
only be unsightly to mark every instance
where a sentence has been
dropt. The italics, we must remark,
are not ours. If Lamb's, they show
how naturally, even in writing to his
most intimate friend, he fell into the
feelings of the author:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"<i>May 10, 1806.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... Be sure, if you see any of
those people whose heads do grow beneath
their shoulders, that you make a
draught of them. It will be very curious.
Oh! Manning, I am serious to sinking
almost, when I think that all those
evenings which you have made so pleasant
are gone, perhaps for ever. Four years,
you talk of, may be ten&mdash;and you may
come back and find such alterations!
Some circumstance may grow up to you
or to me, that may be a bar to the return
of any such intimacy. I dare say all this
is hum! and that all will come back;
but, indeed, we die many deaths before
we die, and I am almost sick to think
that such a hold I had of you is gone."</p></blockquote>

<p>
"<i>Dec. 5, 1806.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Manning, your letter dated Hottentots,
August the&mdash;what was it? came to
hand. I can scarce hope that mine will
have the same luck. China&mdash;Canton&mdash;bless
us! how it strains the imagination,
and makes it ache. It will be a point of
conscience to send you none but bran-new
news (the latest edition), which will
but grow the better, like oranges, for
a sea voyage. Oh that you should be so
many hemispheres off&mdash;if I speak incorrectly
you can correct me&mdash;why, the simplest
death or marriage that takes place
here must be important to you as news in
the old Bastile."</p></blockquote>

<p>He then tells him of the acceptance
of his farce&mdash;<i>Mr H.</i>; which farce, by
the way, was produced, and failed,
Lamb turning against his own production,
and joining the audience in
hissing it off the stage. It certainly
deserved its fate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, you'd like to know the subject.
The title is, 'Mr H.' No more; how
simple, how taking! A great H sprawling
over the play-bill, and attracting eyes
at every corner. The story is, a coxcomb
appearing at Bath, vastly rich&mdash;all the
ladies dying for him&mdash;all bursting to
know who he is; but he goes by no other
name than Mr H.&mdash;a curiosity like that
of the dames of Strasburg about the man
with the great nose. But I won't tell
you any more about it. Yes, I will; but
I can't give you any idea how I have
done it. I'll just tell you that, after
much vehement admiration, when his true
name comes out, 'Hogsflesh,' all the
women shun him, avoid him, and not one
can be found to change her name for him;
that's the idea&mdash;how flat it is here&mdash;but
how whimsical in the farce! And only
think how hard upon me it is, that the
ship is despatched to-morrow, and my
triumph cannot be ascertained till the
Wednesday after. But all China will
ring of it by-and-by. Do you find, in all
this stuff I have written, anything like
those feelings which one should send my
old adventuring friend that is gone to
wander among Tartars, and may never
come again? I don't; but your going
away, and all about you, is a threadbare
topic. I have worn it out with thinking.
It has come to me when I have been dull
with anything, till my sadness has seemed
more to have come from it than to have
introduced it. I want you, you don't
know how much; but if I had you here,
in my European garret, we should but
talk over such stuff as I have written.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! what a bit only I've
got left! How shall I squeeze all I know
into this morsel! Coleridge is come home,
and is going to turn lecturer on taste at
the Royal Institution. How the paper
grows less and less! In less than two
minutes I shall cease to talk to you, and
you may rave to the great Wall of China.&mdash;N.B.
Is there such a wall? Is it as big
as Old London Wall by Bedlam? Have
you met with a friend of mine, named
Ball, at Canton? If you are acquainted,
remember me kindly to him."</p></blockquote>

<p>But we should be driven into as
hard straits as Lamb, at the close of
his epistle, if we, should attempt, in
the small space that remains to us, to
give any fair idea of the various
"humours" and interests, of many
kinds, of these letters. We pass at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
once to those that illustrate the last
important incident of his life, his retirement
from office. It is thus he
describes his manumission, and the
sort of troubled delight it brought
with it, to Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"<i>6th April, 1825.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here am I then, after thirty-three
years' slavery, sitting in my own room, at
eleven o'clock this finest of all April mornings,
a freed man, with &pound;441 a-year for
the remainder of my life, live I as long
as John Dennis, who outlived his annuity
and starved at ninety.</p>

<p>"I came home <span class="smcap">FOR EVER</span> on Tuesday
of last week. The incomprehensibleness
of my condition overwhelmed me. It was
like passing from life into eternity. Every
year to be as long as three; <i>i. e.</i>, to have
three times as much real time&mdash;time that
is my own in it! I wandered about thinking
I was happy, but feeling I was not.
But that tumultuousness is passing off,
and I begin to understand the nature of
the gift."</p></blockquote>

<p>And to Bernard Barton he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My spirits are so tumultuary with
the novelty of my recent emancipation,
that I have scarce steadiness of hand,
much more of mind, to compose a letter.
I am free, Bernard Barton&mdash;free as air!</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The little bird, that wings the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows no such liberty.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>I was set free on Tuesday in last week at
four o'clock. I came home for ever!</p>

<p>"I have been describing my feelings,
as well as I can, to Wordsworth, and
care not to repeat. Take it briefly, that
for a few days I was painfully oppressed
by so mighty a change, but it is becoming
daily more natural to me. I went and
sat among them all, at my old thirty-three
years' desk yester morning; and
deuce take me, if I had not yearnings at
leaving all my old pen-and-ink fellows,
merry sociable lads, at leaving them in
the lurch&mdash;fag, fag, fag! The comparison
of my own superior felicity gave me anything
but pleasure.</p>

<p>But to live without any steady
compulsory occupation requires an
apprenticeship as much as any other
mode of life. An idle man ought to
be born and bred to the profession.
With Lamb, literature could be nothing
but an amusement, and for a
mere amusement literature is far too
laborious. It cannot, indeed, serve
long as an amusement except when it
is adopted also as a labour. He was
destined, therefore, to make the humiliating
discovery, which so many
have made before him, that one may
have too much time, as well as too
little, at one's own disposal. Writing
to the same Bernard Barton, a year
or two afterwards, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What I can do, and over-do, is to
walk; but deadly long are the days,
these summer all-day days, with but a
half-hour's candle-light and no fire-light.
I do not write, tell your kind inquisitive
Eliza, and can hardly read. 'Tis cold
work authorship, without something to
puff one into fashion.... I assure
you <i>no work</i> is worse than <i>over-work</i>. The
mind preys on itself, the most unwholesome
food. I bragged, formerly, that I
could not have too much time. I have a
surfeit; with few years to come, the days
are wearisome. But weariness is not
eternal. Something will shine out to
take the load off that crushes me, which
is at present intolerable. I have killed
an hour or two in this poor scrawl. Well;
I shall write merrier anon. 'Tis the present
copy of my countenance I send, and
to complain is a little to alleviate."</p></blockquote>

<p>He had taken a house at Enfield,
but the cares of housekeeping were
found to be burdensome to Miss Lamb,
and they took up their abode as
boarders in the house of a neighbour.
To this circumstance he alludes in the
following extract from a letter to
Wordsworth, which is the last we
shall make, and with which we shall
bid farewell to our subject. It will
be found to be not the least remarkable
amongst the letters of Lamb, and
contains one passage, we think, the
boldest piece of extravagance that
ever humorist ventured upon with success.
It just escapes!&mdash;and, indeed, it
rather takes away our breath at its
boldness than prompts to merriment.</p>

<p>"And is it a year since we parted from
you at the steps of Edmonton stage?
There are not now the years that there
used to be. The tale of the dwindled
age of men, reported of successional mankind,
is true of the same man only. We
do not live a year in a year now. 'Tis a
<i>punctum stans</i>. The seasons pass with
indifference. Spring cheers not, nor winter
heightens our gloom; autumn hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
foregone its moralities. Let the sullen
nothing pass. Suffice it, that after sad
spirits, prolonged through many of its
months, we have cast our skins; have
taken a farewell of the pompous, troublesome
trifle, called housekeeping, and are
settled down into poor boarders and lodgers
at next door, the Baucis and Baucida
of dull Enfield. Here we have nothing
to do with our victuals but to eat them;
with the garden but to see it grow; with
the tax-gatherer but to hear him knock;
with the maid but to hear her scolded.
Scot and lot, butcher, baker, are things
unknown to us, save as spectators of the
pageant. We are fed we know not how;

self-condemned obliviousness, in the stagnation,
some molesting yearnings of life,
not quite killed, rise, prompting me that
there was a London, and that I was of
that old Jerusalem. In dreams I am in
Fleet Market, but I wake and cry to
sleep again. I die hard, a stubborn
Eloisa in this detestable Paraclete. What
have I gained by health? Intolerable
dulness. What by early hours and moderate
meals? A total blank. Oh! let
no native Londoner imagine that health,
and rest, and innocent occupation, interchange
of converse sweet, and recreative
study, can make the country anything
better than altogether odious and detestable.

boldness, luckily sinned himself out of

<p>Any further summary than what
we have already given, of the literary
character of Lamb, would be only
tedious. He is one who will be
generally <i>liked</i>, who with a smaller
class will be greatly admired, and
who will never excite hostile criticism,
unless his injudicious friends
shall elevate him to a higher pedestal
than is due to him, or than he is
manifestly fit to occupy. Such is the
cold and calm verdict with which criticism
must dismiss him. But those
who have thoroughly enjoyed the
essays of Elia and the letters of Lamb,
will feel a warmer, a more partial
affection than Criticism knows well
how to express: she becomes somewhat
impatient of her own enforced
gravity; she would willingly throw
away those scales with which, like
Justice, we suppose, she is symbolically
supplied, and, embracing the
man as he is, laugh and be pleased
with the rest of the world, without
further thought of the matter.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, be this note for you?"
asked the waiter.</p>

<p>"For me&mdash;yes; it is my name."</p>

<p>I did not recognise the handwriting,
and yet the note was from one whose
writing I had often seen. But formerly
the writing was cramped, stiff,
perpendicular, (a feigned hand, though
I guessed not it was feigned;) now
it was hasty, irregular, impatient&mdash;scarce
a letter formed, scarce a word
that seemed finished&mdash;and yet strangely
legible withal, as the handwriting
of a bold man almost always is. I
opened the note listlessly, and
read&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have watched for you all the
morning. I saw her go. Well!&mdash;I
did not throw myself under the hoofs
of the horses. I write this in a public-house,
not far. Will you follow
the bearer, and see once again the
outcast whom all the rest of the world
will shun?"</p>

<p>Though I did not recognise the
hand, there could be no doubt who
was the writer.</p>

<p>"The boy wants to know if there's
an answer," said the waiter.</p>

<p>I nodded, took up my hat, and left
the room. A ragged boy was standing
in the yard, and scarcely six words
passed between us, before I was following
him through a narrow lane
that faced the inn, and terminated in
a turnstile. Here the boy paused,
and, making me a sign to go on, went
back his way whistling. I passed the
turnstile, and found myself in a green
field, with a row of stunted willows
hanging over a narrow rill. I looked
round, and saw Vivian (as I intend
still to call him) half kneeling, and
seemingly intent upon some object in
the grass.</p>

<p>My eye followed his mechanically.
A young unfledged bird, that had left
the nest too soon, stood, all still and
alone, on the bare short sward&mdash;its
beak open as for food, its gaze fixed
on us with a wistful stare. Methought
there was something in the forlorn
bird that softened me more to the forlorner
youth, of whom it seemed a
type.</p>

<p>"Now," said Vivian, speaking half
to himself, half to me, "did the bird
fall from the nest, or leave the nest at
its own wild whim? The parent does
not protect it. Mind, I say not it is
the parent's fault&mdash;perhaps the fault
is all with the wanderer. But, look
you, though the parent is not here,
the foe is!&mdash;yonder, see!"</p>

<p>And the young man pointed to a
large brindled cat, that, kept back
from its prey by our unwelcome neighbourhood,
still remained watchful, a
few paces off, stirring its tail gently
backwards and forwards, and with
that stealthy look in its round eyes,
dulled by the sun&mdash;half fierce, half
frightened&mdash;which belongs to its tribe,
when man comes between the devourer
and the victim.</p>

<p>"I do see," said I, "but a passing
footstep has saved the bird!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Vivian, laying my
hand on his own, and with his old
bitter smile on his lip&mdash;"stop! do
you think it mercy to save the bird?
What from? and what for? From a
natural enemy&mdash;from a short pang
and a quick death? Fie!&mdash;is not that
better than slow starvation? or, if
you take more heed of it, than the
prison-bars of a cage? You cannot
restore the nest, you cannot recall
the parent. Be wiser in your mercy:
leave the bird to its gentlest fate!"</p>

<p>I looked hard on Vivian; the lip
had lost the bitter smile. He rose
and turned away. I sought to take
up the poor bird, but it did not know
its friends, and ran from me, chirping
piteously&mdash;ran towards the very jaws
of the grim enemy. I was only just
in time to scare away the beast, which
sprang up a tree, and glared down
through the hanging boughs. Then I
followed the bird, and, as I followed,
I heard, not knowing, at first whence
the sound came, a short, quick, tremulous
note. Was it near? was it far?&mdash;from
the earth? in the sky? Poor
parent-bird!&mdash;like parent-love, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
seemed now far and now near; now
on earth, now in sky!</p>

<p>And at last, quick and sudden, as if
born of the space, lo! the little wings
hovered over me!</p>

<p>The young bird halted, and I also.
"Come," said I, "ye have found each
other at last&mdash;settle it between you!"</p>

<p>I went back to the outcast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;How came you to
know we had stayed in the town?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span>&mdash;Do you think I could remain
where you left me? I wandered
out&mdash;wandered hither. Passing at
dawn through yon streets, I saw the
ostlers loitering by the gates of the
yard, overheard them talk, and so
knew you were all at the inn&mdash;all!
(<i>He sighed heavily.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Your poor father is
very ill! O cousin, how could you
fling from you so much love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span>&mdash;Love!&mdash;his!&mdash;my father's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Do you really not
believe, then, that your father loved
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span>&mdash;If I had believed it, I had
never left him! All the gold of the
Indies had never bribed me to leave

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;This is indeed a
strange misconception of yours. If
we can remove it, all may be well yet.
Need there now be any secrets between
us? (<i>persuasively.</i>) Sit down,
and tell me all, cousin.</p>

<p>After some hesitation, Vivian complied;
and by the clearing of his brow,
and the very tone of his voice, I felt
sure that he was no longer seeking to
disguise the truth. But, as I afterwards
learned the father's tale as well
as now the son's, so, instead of repeating
Vivian's words, which&mdash;not
by design, but by the twist of a mind
habitually wrong&mdash;distorted the facts,
I will state what appears to me the
real case, as between the parties so
unhappily opposed. Reader, pardon
me if the recital be tedious. And if
thou thinkest that I bear not hard
enough on the erring hero of the
story, remember that he who recites
judges as Austin's son must judge of
Roland's.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LXXXVI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span></p>

<p>AT THE ENTRANCE OF LIFE SITS&mdash;THE MOTHER.</p>

<p>It was during the war in Spain that
a severe wound, and the fever which
ensued, detained Roland at the house
of a Spanish widow. His hostess had
once been rich; but her fortune had
been ruined in the general calamities
of the country. She had an only
daughter, who assisted to nurse and
tend the wounded Englishman; and
when the time approached for Roland's
departure, the frank grief of
the young Ramouna betrayed the
impression that the guest had made
upon her affections. Much of gratitude,
and something, it might be, of an
exquisite sense of honour, aided, in
Roland's breast, the charm naturally
produced by the beauty of his young
nurse, and the knightly compassion he
felt for her ruined fortunes and desolate
condition.</p>

<p>In one of those hasty impulses
common to a generous nature&mdash;and
which too often fatally vindicate the
rank of Prudence amidst the tutelary
Powers of Life&mdash;Roland committed
the error of marriage with a girl of
whose connexions he knew nothing,
and of whose nature little more than
its warm spontaneous susceptibility.
In a few days subsequent to these
rash nuptials, Roland rejoined the
march of the army; nor was he able
to return to Spain till after the crowning
victory of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Maimed by the loss of a limb, and
with the scars of many a noble wound
still fresh, Roland then hastened to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
home the dreams of which had soothed
the bed of pain, and now replaced the
earlier visions of renown. During
his absence a son had been born to
him&mdash;a son whom he might rear to
take the place he had left in his country's
service; to renew, in some future
fields, a career that had failed
the romance of his own antique and
chivalrous ambition. As soon as that
news had reached him, his care had
been to provide an English nurse for
the infant&mdash;so that, with the first
sounds of the mother's endearments,
the child might yet hear a voice from
the father's land. A female relation
of Bolt's had settled in Spain, and
was induced to undertake this duty. Natural
as this appointment was to a man
so devotedly English, it displeased his
wild and passionate Ramouna. She
had that mother's jealousy, strongest
in minds uneducated; she had also
that peculiar pride which belongs to
her country-people, of every rank
and condition; the jealousy and the
pride were both wounded by the sight
of the English nurse at the child's
cradle.</p>

<p>That Roland, on regaining his Spanish
hearth, should be disappointed in
his expectations of the happiness
awaiting him there, was the inevitable
condition of such a marriage;
since, not the less for his military
bluntness, Roland had that refinement
of feeling, perhaps over-fastidious,
which belongs to all natures essentially
poetic; and as the first illusions
of love died away, there could have
been little indeed congenial to his
stately temper in one divided from
him by an utter absence of education,
and by the strong but nameless distinctions
of national views and manners.
The disappointment probably,
however, went deeper than that
which usually attends an ill-assorted
union; for, instead of bringing his
wife to his old tower, (an expatriation
which she would doubtless have
resisted to the utmost,) he accepted,
maimed as he was, not very long after
his return to Spain, the offer of a
military post under Ferdinand. The
Cavalier doctrines and intense loyalty
of Roland attached him, without reflection,
to the service of a throne which
the English arms had contributed to
establish; while the extreme unpopularity
of the Constitutional Party in
Spain, and the stigma of irreligion
fixed to it by the priests, aided to
foster Roland's belief that he was supporting
a beloved king against the
professors of those revolutionary and
Jacobinical doctrines, which to him
were the very atheism of politics.
The experience of a few years in the
service of a bigot so contemptible as
Ferdinand, whose highest object of
patriotism was the restoration of the
Inquisition, added another disappointment
to those which had already embittered
the life of a man who had
seen in the grand hero of Cervantes
no follies to satirise, but high virtues
to imitate. Poor Quixote himself&mdash;he
came mournfully back to his La
Mancha, with no other reward for his
knight-errantry than a decoration
which he disdained to place beside his
simple Waterloo medal, and a grade
for which he would have blushed to
resign his more modest, but more
honourable English dignity.</p>

<p>But, still weaving hopes, the sanguine
man returned to his Penates.
His child now had grown from infancy
into boyhood&mdash;the child would
pass naturally into his care. Delightful
occupation!&mdash;At the thought,
Home smiled again.</p>

<p>Now, behold the most pernicious
circumstance in this ill-omened connexion.</p>

<p>The father of Ramouna had been
one of that strange and mysterious
race which presents in Spain so many
features distinct from the characteristics
of its kindred tribes in more civilised
lands. The Git&aacute;no, or gipsy of
Spain, is not the mere vagrant we see
on our commons and roadsides. Retaining,
indeed, much of his lawless
principles and predatory inclinations,
he lives often in towns, exercises
various callings, and not unfrequently
becomes rich. A wealthy Git&aacute;no
had married a Spanish woman;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Roland's wife had been the offspring
of this marriage. The Git&aacute;no had
died while Ramouna was yet extremely
young, and her childhood had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>been free from the influences of her
paternal kindred. But, though her
mother, retaining her own religion,
had brought up Ramouna in the same
faith, pure from the godless creed of
the Git&aacute;no&mdash;and, at her husband's
death, had separated herself wholly
from his tribe&mdash;still she had lost caste
with her own kin and people. And
while struggling to regain it, the fortune,
which made her sole chance of
success in that attempt, was swept
away, so that she had remained apart
and solitary, and could bring no
friends to cheer the solitude of Ramouna
during Roland's absence. But,
while my uncle was still in the service
of Ferdinand, the widow died; and
then the only relatives who came
round Ramouna were her father's
kindred. They had not ventured to
claim affinity while her mother lived;
and they did so now, by attentions
and caresses to her son. This opened
to them at once Ramouna's heart and
doors. Meanwhile, the English nurse&mdash;who,
in spite of all that could render
her abode odious to her, had,
from strong love to her charge, stoutly
maintained her post&mdash;died, a few
weeks after Ramouna's mother, and
no healthful influence remained to
counteract those baneful ones to which
the heir of the honest old Caxtons
was subjected. But Roland returned
home in a humour to be pleased with
all things. Joyously he clasped his
wife to his breast, and thought, with
self-reproach, that he had forborne
too little, and exacted too much&mdash;he
would be wiser now. Delightedly he
acknowledged the beauty, the intelligence,
and manly bearing of the boy,
who played with his sword-knot, and
ran off with his pistols as a prize.</p>

<p>The news of the Englishman's
arrival at first kept the lawless kinsfolk
from the house; but they were
fond of the boy, and the boy of them,
and interviews between him and these
wild comrades, if stolen, were not less
frequent. Gradually Roland's eyes
became opened. As, in habitual intercourse,
the boy abandoned the reserve
which awe and cunning at first
imposed, Roland was inexpressibly
shocked at the bold principles his son
affected, and at his utter incapacity
even to comprehend that plain honesty
and that frank honour which, to the
English soldier, seemed ideas innate
and heaven-planted. Soon afterwards,
Roland found that a system of
plunder was carried on in his household,
and tracked it to the connivance
of the wife and the agency of the son,
for the benefit of lazy bravos and dissolute
vagrants. A more patient man
than Roland might well have been
exasperated&mdash;a more wary man confounded,
by this discovery. He took
the natural step&mdash;perhaps insisting on
it too summarily&mdash;perhaps not allowing
enough for the uncultured mind
and lively passions of his wife: he
ordered her instantly to prepare to
accompany him from the place, and
to give up all communication with her
kindred.</p>

<p>A vehement refusal ensued; but
Roland was not a man to give up
such a point, and at length a false
submission, and a feigned repentance
soothed his resentment and obtained
his pardon. They moved several
miles from the place; but where they
moved, there, some at least, and
those the worst, of the baleful brood,
stealthily followed. Whatever Ramouna's
earlier love for Roland had
been, it had evidently long ceased in
the thorough want of sympathy between
them, and in that absence
which, if it renews a strong affection,
destroys an affection already weakened.
But the mother and son adored
each other with all the strength of
their strong, wild natures. Even under
ordinary circumstances, the father's
influence over a boy yet in childhood
is exerted in vain, if the mother lend
herself to baffle it. And in this miserable
position, what chance had the
blunt, stern, honest Roland (separated
from his son during the most ductile
years of infancy) against the ascendency
of a mother who humoured all
the faults, and gratified all the wishes,
of her darling?</p>

<p>In his despair, Roland let fall the
threat that, if thus thwarted, it would
become his duty to withdraw his son
from the mother. This threat instantly
hardened both hearts against
him. The wife represented Roland
to the boy as a tyrant, as an enemy&mdash;as
one who had destroyed all the
happiness they had before enjoyed in
each other&mdash;as one whose severity
showed that he hated his own child;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and the boy believed her. In his own
house a firm union was formed against
Roland, and protected by the cunning
which is the force of the weak against
the strong.</p>

<p>In spite of all, Roland could never
forget the tenderness with which the
young nurse had watched over the
wounded man, nor the love&mdash;genuine
for the hour, though not drawn from
the feelings which withstand the wear
and tear of life&mdash;that lips so beautiful
had pledged him in the bygone days.
These thoughts must have come perpetually
between his feelings and his
judgment, to embitter still more his
position&mdash;to harass still more his
heart. And if, by the strength of
that sense of duty which made the
force of his character, he could have
strung himself to the fulfilment of the
threat, humanity, at all events, compelled
him to delay it&mdash;his wife promised
to be again a mother. Blanche
was born. How could he take the
infant from the mother's breast, or
abandon the daughter to the fatal
influences from which only, by so
violent an effort, he could free the son?</p>

<p>No wonder, poor Roland! that those
deep furrows contracted thy bold
front, and thy hair grew gray before
its time!</p>

<p>Fortunately, perhaps, for all parties,
Roland's wife died while Blanche
was still an infant. She was taken
ill of a fever&mdash;she died delirious,
clasping her boy to her breast, and
praying the saints to protect him from
his cruel father. How often that
deathbed haunted the son, and justified
his belief that there was no parent's
love in the heart which was
now his sole shelter from the world,
and the "pelting of its pitiless rain."
Again I say, poor Roland!&mdash;for I know
that, in that harsh, unloving disrupture
of such solemn ties, thy large
generous heart forgot its wrongs;
again didst thou see tender eyes bending
over the wounded stranger&mdash;again
hear low murmurs breathe the warm
weakness which the women of the
south deem it no shame to own. And
now did it all end in those ravings of
hate, and in that glazing gaze of
terror!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LXXXVII.</h3>

<p>THE PRECEPTOR.</p>

<p>Roland removed to France, and
fixed his abode in the environs of
Paris. He placed Blanche at a convent
in the immediate neighbourhood,
going to see her daily, and gave himself
up to the education of his son.
The boy was apt to learn; but to unlearn
was here the arduous task&mdash;and
for that task it would have needed
either the passionless experience, the
exquisite forbearance of a practised
teacher, or the love, and confidence,
and yielding heart of a believing
pupil. Roland felt that he was not
the man to be the teacher, and that
his son's heart remained obstinately
closed to him. He looked round, and
found at the other side of Paris what
seemed a suitable preceptor&mdash;a young
Frenchman of some distinction in
letters, more especially in science,
with all a Frenchman's eloquence of
talk, full of high-sounding sentiments,
that pleased the romantic enthusiasm
of the Captain; so Roland, with sanguine
hopes, confided his son to this
man's care. The boy's natural quickness
mastered readily all that pleased
his taste; he learned to speak and
write French with rare felicity and
precision. His tenacious memory,
and those flexile organs in which the
talent for languages is placed, served,
with the help of an English master,
to revive his earlier knowledge of his
father's tongue, and to enable him to
speak it with fluent correctness&mdash;though
there was always in his accent
something which had struck me as
strange; but, not suspecting it to be
foreign, I had thought it a theatrical
affectation. He did not go far into
science&mdash;little farther, perhaps, than
a smattering of French mathematics;
but he acquired a remarkable facility
and promptitude in calculation. He
devoured eagerly the light reading
thrown in his way, and picked up
thence that kind of knowledge which
novels and plays afford, for good or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
evil, according as the novel or the
play elevates the understanding and
ennobles the passions, or merely corrupts
the fancy, and lowers the standard
of human nature. But of all
that Roland desired him to be taught,
the son remained as ignorant as before.
Among the other misfortunes
of this ominous marriage, Roland's
wife had possessed all the superstitions
of a Roman Catholic Spaniard,
and with these the boy had unconsciously
intermingled doctrines far
more dreary, imbibed from the dark
paganism of the Git&aacute;nos.</p>

<p>Roland had sought a Protestant for
his son's tutor. The preceptor was
nominally a Protestant&mdash;a biting
derider of all superstitions indeed!
He was such a Protestant as some
defender of Voltaire's religion says
the Great Wit would have been had
he lived in a Protestant country. The
Frenchman laughed the boy out of
his superstitions, to leave behind them
the sneering scepticism of the <i>Encyclop&eacute;die</i>,
without those redeeming
ethics on which all sects of philosophy
are agreed, but which, unhappily, it
requires a philosopher to comprehend.</p>

<p>This preceptor was doubtless not
aware of the mischief he was doing;
and for the rest, he taught his pupil
after his own system&mdash;a mild and
plausible one, very much like the
system we at home are recommended
to adopt&mdash;"Teach the understanding,
all else will follow;" "Learn to read
<i>something</i>, and it will all come right;"
"Follow the bias of the pupil's mind;
thus you develop genius, not thwart
it." Mind, Understanding, Genius&mdash;fine
things! But, to educate the whole
man, you must educate something
more than these. Not for want of
mind, understanding, genius, have
Borgias and Neros left their names
as monuments of horror to mankind.
Where, in all this teaching, was one
lesson to warm the heart and guide
the soul?</p>

<p>O mother mine! that the boy had
stood by thy knee, and heard from thy
lips, why life was given us, in what
life shall end, and how heaven stands
open to us night and day! O father
mine! that thou hadst been his preceptor,
not in book-learning, but the
heart's simple wisdom! Oh! that he
had learned from thee, in parables
closed with practice, the happiness of
self-sacrifice, and how "good deeds
should repair the bad!"</p>

<p>It was the misfortune of this boy,
with his daring and his beauty, that
there was in his exterior and his
manner that which attracted indulgent
interest, and a sort of compassionate
admiration. The Frenchman liked
him&mdash;believed his story&mdash;thought him
ill-treated by that hard-visaged English
soldier. All English people were
so disagreeable, particularly English
soldiers; and the Captain once mortally
offended the Frenchman, by calling
Vilainton <i>un grand homme</i>, and
denying, with brutal indignation, that
the English had poisoned Napoleon!
So, instead of teaching the son to love
and revere his father, the Frenchman
shrugged his shoulders when the boy
broke into some unfilial complaint,
and at most said, "<i>Mais, cher enfant,
ton p&egrave;re est Anglais&mdash;c'est tout dire</i>."
Meanwhile, as the child sprang rapidly
into precocious youth, he was permitted
a liberty in his hours of leisure,
of which he availed himself with all
the zest of his early habits and adventurous
temper. He formed acquaintances
among the loose young haunters
of caf&eacute;s, and spendthrifts of that
capital&mdash;the wits! He became an
excellent swordsman and pistol-shot&mdash;adroit
in all games in which skill
helps fortune. He learned betimes to
furnish himself with money, by the
cards and the billiard-balls.</p>

<p>But, delighted with the easy home
he had obtained, he took care to
school his features, and smooth his
manner, in his father's visits&mdash;to
make the most of what he had learned
of less ignoble knowledge, and, with
his characteristic imitativeness, to
cite the finest sentiments he had found
in his plays and novels. What father
is not credulous? Roland believed,
and wept tears of joy. And now he
thought the time was come to take
back the boy&mdash;to return with a worthy
heir to the old Tower. He thanked
and blest the tutor&mdash;he took the son.
But, under pretence that he had yet
some things to master, whether in
book knowledge or manly accomplishments,
the youth begged his
father, at all events, not yet to return
to England&mdash;to let him attend his
tutor daily for some months. Roland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
consented, moved from his old quarters,
and took a lodging for both in
the same suburb as that in which the
teacher resided. But soon, when
they were under one roof, the boy's
habitual tastes, and his repugnance
to all paternal authority, were betrayed.
To do my unhappy cousin
justice, (such as that justice is,)
though he had the cunning for a short
disguise, he had not the hypocrisy to
maintain systematic deceit. He could
play a part for a while, from an
exulting joy in his own address; but
he could not wear a mask with the
patience of cold-blooded dissimulation.
Why enter into painful details,
so easily divined by the intelligent
reader? The faults of the son were
precisely those to which Roland would
be least indulgent. To the ordinary
scrapes of high-spirited boyhood, no
father, I am sure, would have been
more lenient; but to anything that
seemed low, petty&mdash;that grated on
him as gentleman and soldier&mdash;there,
not for worlds would I have braved
the darkness of his frown, and the
woe that spoke like scorn in his voice.
And when, after all warning and prohibition
were in vain, Roland found
his son, in the middle of the night, in
a resort of gamblers and sharpers,
carrying all before him with his cue,
in the full flush of triumph, and a
great heap of five-franc pieces before
him&mdash;you may conceive with what
wrath the proud, hasty, passionate
man, drove out, cane in hand, the
obscene associates, flinging after them
the son's ill-gotten gains; and with
what resentful humiliation the son
was compelled to follow the father
home. Then Roland took the boy to
England, but not to the old Tower;
that hearth of his ancestors was still
too sacred for the footsteps of the
vagrant heir!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LXXXVIII.</h3>

<p>THE HEARTH WITHOUT TRUST, AND THE WORLD WITHOUT A GUIDE.</p>

<p>And then, vainly grasping at every
argument his blunt sense could suggest&mdash;then
talked Roland much and
grandly of the duties men owed&mdash;even
if they threw off all love to their
father&mdash;still to their father's name;
and then his pride, always so lively,
grew irritable and harsh, and seemed,
no doubt, to the perverted ears of the
son, unlovely and unloving. And
that pride, without serving one purpose
of good, did yet more mischief;
for the youth caught the disease, but
in a wrong way. And he said to
himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho! then my father is a great
man, with all these ancestors and big
words! And he has lands and a
castle&mdash;and yet how miserably we
live, and how he stints me! But if
he has cause for pride in all these
dead men, why, so have I. And are
these lodgings, these appurtenances,
fit for the 'gentleman' he says I
am?"</p>

<p>Even in England, the gipsy blood
broke out as before; and the youth
found vagrant associates, heaven
knows how or where; and strange-looking
forms, gaudily shabby, and
disreputably smart, were seen lurking
in the corner of the street, or peering
in at the window, slinking off if they
saw Roland&mdash;and Roland could not
stoop to be a spy. And the son's
heart grew harder and harder against
his father, and his father's face now
never smiled on him. Then bills
came in, and duns knocked at the
door. Bills and duns to a man who
shrunk from the thought of a debt, as
an ermine from a spot on its hide!
And the son's short answer to remonstrance
was,&mdash;"Am I not a gentleman?&mdash;these
are the things gentlemen
require." Then perhaps Roland
remembered the experiment of his
French friend, and left his bureau
unlocked, and said, "Ruin me if you
will, but no debts. There is money
in those drawers&mdash;they are unlocked."
That trust would for ever have cured
of extravagance a youth with a high
and delicate sense of honour: the
pupil of the Git&aacute;nos did not understand
the trust; he thought it conveyed
a natural though ungracious
permission to take out what he
wanted&mdash;and he took! To Roland
this seemed a theft, and a theft of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
coarsest kind: but when he so said,
the son started indignant, and saw in
that which had been so touching an
appeal to his honour, but a trap to
decoy him into disgrace. In short,
neither could understand the other.
Roland forbade his son to stir from
the house; and the young man the
same night let himself out, and stole
forth into the wide world, to enjoy or
defy it in his own wild way.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to follow him
through his various adventures and
experiments on fortune, (even if I
knew them all, which I do not.) And
now, putting altogether aside his right
name, which he had voluntarily abandoned,
and not embarrassing the
reader with the earlier aliases assumed,
I shall give to my unfortunate
kinsman the name by which I
first knew him, and continue to do so,
until&mdash;heaven grant the time may
come!&mdash;having first redeemed, he may
reclaim, his own. It was in joining a
set of strolling players that Vivian
became acquainted with Peacock;
and that worthy, who had many
strings to his bow, soon grew aware
of Vivian's extraordinary skill with
the cue, and saw therein a better
mode of making their joint fortunes
than the boards of an itinerant Thespis
furnished to either. Vivian listened
to him, and it was while their intimacy
was most fresh that I met them
on the highroad. That chance meeting
produced (if I may be allowed to
believe his assurance) a strong, and,
for the moment, a salutary effect upon
Vivian. The comparative innocence
and freshness of a boy's mind were
new to him; the elastic healthful
spirits with which those gifts were
accompanied startled him, by the
contrast to his own forced gaiety and
secret gloom. And this boy was his
own cousin!</p>

<p>Coming afterwards to London, he
adventured inquiry at the hotel in the
Strand at which I had given my
address; learned where we were;
and, passing one night in the street,
saw my uncle at the window&mdash;to
recognise and to fly from him. Having
then some money at his disposal,
he broke off abruptly from the set into
which he had been thrown. He resolved
to return to France&mdash;he would
try for a more respectable mode of
existence. He had not found happiness
in that liberty he had won, nor
room for the ambition that began to
gnaw him, in those pursuits from
which his father had vainly warned
him. His most reputable friend
was his old tutor; he would go to
him. He went; but the tutor was
now married, and was himself a
father, and that made a wonderful
alteration in his practical ethics. It
was no longer moral to aid the son
in rebellion to his father. Vivian
evinced his usual sarcastic haughtiness
at the reception he met, and was
requested civilly to leave the house.
Then again he flung himself on his
wits at Paris. But there were plenty
of wits there sharper than his own.
He got into some quarrel with the
police&mdash;not indeed for any dishonest
practices of his own, but from an
unwary acquaintance with others less
scrupulous, and deemed it prudent to
quit France. Thus had I met him
again, forlorn and ragged, in the
streets of London.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roland, after the first
vain search, had yielded to the indignation
and disgust that had long rankled
within him. His son had thrown off
his authority, because it preserved
him from dishonour. His ideas of
discipline were stern, and patience
had been wellnigh crushed out of his
heart. He thought he could bear to
resign his son to his fate&mdash;to disown
him, and to say, "I have no more a
son." It was in this mood that he had
first visited our house. But when, on
that memorable night in which he had
narrated to his thrilling listeners the
dark tale of a fellow-sufferer's woe and
crime&mdash;betraying in the tale, to my
father's quick sympathy, his own sorrow
and passion&mdash;it did not need much
of his gentler brother's subtle art to
learn or guess the whole, nor much
of Austin's mild persuasion to convince
Roland that he had not yet
exhausted all efforts to track the wanderer
and reclaim the erring child.
Then he had gone to London&mdash;then he
had sought every spot which the outcast
would probably haunt&mdash;then had
he saved and pinched from his own
necessities, to have wherewithal to
enter theatres and gaming-houses, and
fee the agencies of police; then had
he seen the form for which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
watched and pined, in the street below
his window, and cried in a joyous delusion,
"He repents!" One day a letter
reached my uncle, through his
banker's, from the French tutor, (who
knew of no other means of tracing Roland
but through the house by which
his salary had been paid,) informing
him of his son's visit. Roland started
instantly for Paris. Arriving there, he
could only learn of his son through
the police, and from them only learn
that he had been seen in the company
of accomplished swindlers, who were
already in the hands of justice; but
that the youth himself, whom there
was nothing to criminate, had been
suffered to quit Paris, and had taken,
it was supposed, the road to England.
Then at last the poor Captain's stout
heart gave way. His son the companion
of swindlers!&mdash;could he be sure
that he was not their accomplice? If
not yet, how small the step between
companionship and participation! He
took the child left him still from the
convent, returned to England, and
arrived there to be seized with fever
and delirium&mdash;apparently on the same
day (or a day before that on which)
the son had dropped shelterless and
penniless on the stones of London.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LXXXIX.</h3>

<p>THE ATTEMPT TO BUILD A TEMPLE TO FORTUNE OUT OF THE RUINS OF HOME.</p>

<p>"But," said Vivian, pursuing his
tale, "but when you came to my aid,
not knowing me&mdash;when you relieved
me&mdash;when from your own lips, for the
first time, I heard words that praised
me, and for qualities that implied I
might yet be 'worth much.'&mdash;Ah! (he
added mournfully,) I remember the
very words&mdash;a new light broke upon
me&mdash;struggling and dim, but light
still. The ambition with which I had
sought the truckling Frenchman revived,
and took worthier and more
definite form. I would lift myself
above the mire, make a name, rise in
life!"</p>

<p>Vivian's head drooped, but he raised
it quickly, and laughed&mdash;his low mocking
laugh. What follows of his tale
may be told succinctly. Retaining
his bitter feelings towards his father,
he resolved to continue his incognito&mdash;he
gave himself a name likely to
mislead conjecture, if I conversed of
him to my family, since he knew that
Roland was aware that a Colonel
Vivian had been afflicted by a runaway
son&mdash;and, indeed, the talk upon that
subject had first put the notion of
flight into his own head. He caught at
the idea of becoming known to Trevanion;
but he saw reasons to forbid
his being indebted to me for the introduction&mdash;to
forbid my knowing where
he was: sooner or later, that knowledge
could scarcely fail to end in the
discovery of his real name. Fortunately,
as he deemed, for the plans he
began to meditate, we were all leaving
London&mdash;he should have the stage to
himself. And then boldly he resolved
upon what he regarded as the master
scheme of life&mdash;viz., to obtain a small
pecuniary independence, and to emancipate
himself formally and entirely
from his father's control. Aware of
poor Roland's chivalrous reverence
for his name, firmly persuaded that
Roland had no love for the son, but
only the dread that the son might
disgrace him, he determined to avail
himself of his father's prejudices in
order to effect his purpose.</p>

<p>He wrote a short letter to Roland,
(that letter which had given the poor
man so sanguine a joy&mdash;that letter
after reading which he had said to
Blanche, "Pray for me,") stating
simply, that he wished to see his father;
and naming a tavern in the city
for the meeting.</p>

<p>The interview took place. And
when Roland, love and forgiveness in
his heart&mdash;but (who shall blame him?)
dignity on his brow, and rebuke in his
eye&mdash;approached, ready at a word to
fling himself on the boy's breast, Vivian,
seeing only the outer signs, and
interpreting them by his own sentiments&mdash;recoiled;
folded his arms on
his bosom, and said coldly, "Spare
me reproach, sir&mdash;it is unavailing. I
seek you only to propose that you
shall save your name, and resign your
son."</p>

<p>Then, intent perhaps but to gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
his object, the unhappy youth declared
his fixed determination never
to live with his father, never to acquiesce
in his authority, resolutely to
pursue his own career, whatever that
career might be, explaining none of
the circumstances that appeared most
in his disfavour&mdash;rather, perhaps,
thinking that, the worse his father
judged of him, the more chance he
had to achieve his purpose. "All I
ask of you," he said, "is this: Give
me the least you can afford to preserve
me from the temptation to rob,
or the necessity to starve; and I, in
my turn, promise never to molest you
in life&mdash;never to degrade you in my
death; whatever my misdeeds, they
will never reflect on yourself, for you
shall never recognise the misdoer!
The name you prize so highly shall
be spared." Sickened and revolted,
Roland attempted no argument&mdash;there
was that in the son's cold manner
which shut out hope, and against
which his pride rose indignant. A
meeker man might have remonstrated,
implored, and wept&mdash;that was not in
Roland's nature. He had but the
choice of three evils, to say to his
son: "Fool, I command thee to follow
me;" or say, "Wretch, since
thou wouldst cast me off as a stranger,
as a stranger I say to thee&mdash;Go,
starve or rob, as thou wilt!" or lastly,
to bow his proud head, stunned
by the blow, and say, "Thou refusest
me the obedience of the son, thou demandest
to be as the dead to me. I
can control thee not from vice, I can
guide thee not to virtue. Thou wouldst
sell me the name I have inherited
stainless, and have as stainless borne.
Be it so!&mdash;Name thy price!"</p>

<p>And something like this last was
the father's choice.</p>

<p>He listened, and was long silent;
and then he said slowly, "Pause before
you decide."</p>

<p>"I have paused long&mdash;my decision
is made! this is the last time we
meet. I see before me now the way
to fortune, fairly, honourably; you can
aid me in it only in the way I have
said. Reject me now, and the option
may never come again to either!"</p>

<p>And then Roland said to himself,
"I have spared and saved for this
son; what care I for aught else than
enough to live without debt, creep
into a corner, and await the grave!
And the more I can give, why the
better chance that he will abjure the vile
associate and the desperate course."
And so, out of that small income,
Roland surrendered to the rebel child
more than the half.</p>

<p>Vivian was not aware of his father's
fortune&mdash;he did not suppose the sum
of two hundred pounds a-year was an
allowance so disproportioned to Roland's
means&mdash;yet when it was named,
even he was struck by the generosity
of one to whom he himself had given
the right to say, "I take thee at thy
word; 'just enough not to starve!'"</p>

<p>But then that hateful cynicism
which, caught from bad men and evil
books, he called "knowledge of the
world," made him think, "it is not for
me, it is only for his name;" and he
said aloud, "I accept these terms,
sir; here is the address of a solicitor
with whom yours can settle them.
Farewell for ever."</p>

<p>At those last words Roland started,
and stretched out his arms vaguely
like a blind man. But Vivian had
already thrown open the window,
(the room was on the ground floor)
and sprang upon the sill. "Farewell,"
he repeated: "tell the world I
am dead."</p>

<p>He leapt into the street, and the
father drew in the outstretched arms,
smote his heart, and said&mdash;"Well,
then, my task in the world of man is
over! I will back to the old ruin&mdash;the
wreck to the wrecks&mdash;and the
sight of tombs I have at least rescued
from dishonour shall comfort me for
all!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XC.</h3>

<p>THE RESULTS&mdash;PERVERTED AMBITION&mdash;SELFISH PASSION&mdash;THE INTELLECT DISTORTED
BY THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE HEART.</p>

<p>Vivian's schemes thus prospered.
He had an income that permitted
him the outward appearances of a
gentleman&mdash;an independence modest
indeed, but independence still. We
were all gone from London. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
letter to me, with the postmark of
the town near which Colonel Vivian
lived, sufficed to confirm my belief in
his parentage, and in his return to his
friends. He then presented himself
to Trevanion as the young man whose
pen I had employed in the member's
service; and knowing that I had
never mentioned his name to Trevanion&mdash;for
without Vivian's permission
I should not, considering his apparent
trust in me, have deemed myself
authorised to do so&mdash;he took that of
Gower, which he selected haphazard
from an old Court Guide, as having
the advantage in common with most
names borne by the higher nobility of
England, viz., of not being confined,
as the ancient names of untitled gentlemen
usually are, to the members of
a single family. And when, with his
usual adaptability and suppleness, he
had contrived to lay aside, or smooth
over, whatever in his manners would
be calculated to displease Trevanion,
and had succeeded in exciting the
interest which that generous statesman
always conceived for ability, he
owned candidly, one day, in the presence
of Lady Ellinor&mdash;for his experience
had taught him the comparative
ease with which the sympathy of
woman is enlisted in anything that
appeals to the imagination, or seems
out of the ordinary beat of life&mdash;that
he had reasons for concealing his
connexions for the present&mdash;that he
had cause to believe I suspected what
they were, and, from mistaken regard
for his welfare, might acquaint his
relations with his whereabouts. He
therefore begged Trevanion, if the
latter had occasion to write to me,
not to mention him. This promise
Trevanion gave, though reluctantly;
for the confidence volunteered to him
seemed to exact the promise; but as
he detested mystery of all kinds, the
avowal might have been fatal to any
farther acquaintance; and under auspices
so doubtful, there would have
been no chance of his obtaining that
intimacy in Trevanion's house which
he desired to establish, but for an
accident which at once opened that
house to him almost as a home.</p>

<p>Vivian had always treasured a lock
of his mother's hair, cut off on her
deathbed; and when he was at his
French tutor's, his first pocket-money
had been devoted to the purchase of
a locket, on which he had caused to
be inscribed his own name and his
mother's. Through all his wanderings
he had worn this relic; and in
the direst pangs of want, no hunger
had been keen enough to induce him
to part with it. Now, one morning
the ribbon that suspended the locket
gave way, and his eye resting on the
names inscribed on the gold, he thought,
in his own vague sense of right, imperfect
as it was, that his compact
with his father obliged him to have
the names erased. He took it to a
jeweller in Piccadilly for that purpose,
and gave the requisite order, not
taking notice of a lady in the further
part of the shop. The locket was
still on the counter after Vivian had
left, when the lady coming forward
observed it, and saw the names on
the surface. She had been struck by
the peculiar tone of the voice, which
she had heard before; and that very
day Mr Gower received a note from
Lady Ellinor Trevanion, requesting
to see him. Much wondering, he
went. Presenting him with the
locket, she said smiling, "There is
only one gentleman in the world who
calls himself <i>De</i> Caxton, unless it be
his son. Ah! I see now why you
wished to conceal yourself from my
friend Pisistratus. But how is this?
can you have any difference with
your father? Confide in me, or it is
my duty to write to him."</p>

<p>Even Vivian's powers of dissimulation
abandoned him, thus taken by
surprise. He saw no alternative but
to trust Lady Ellinor with his secret,
and implore her to respect it. And
then he spoke bitterly of his father's
dislike to him, and his own resolution
to prove the injustice of that dislike
by the position he would himself
establish in the world. At present,
his father believed him dead, and
perhaps was not ill-pleased to think
so. He would not dispel that belief
till he could redeem any boyish errors,
and force his family to be proud to
acknowledge him.</p>

<p>Though Lady Ellinor was slow to believe
that Roland could dislike his son,
she could yet readily believe that he
was harsh and choleric, with a soldier's
high notions of discipline; the young
man's story moved her, his determina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>tion
pleased her own high spirit;&mdash;always
with a touch of romance in
her, and always sympathising with
each desire of ambition&mdash;she entered
into Vivian's aspirations with an
alacrity that surprised himself. She
was charmed with the idea of ministering
to the son's fortunes, and
ultimately reconciling him to the
father,&mdash;through her own agency;&mdash;it
would atone for any fault of which
Roland could accuse herself in the
old time.</p>

<p>She undertook to impart the secret
to Trevanion, for she would have no
secrets from him, and to secure his
acquiescence in its concealment from
all others.</p>

<p>And here I must a little digress from
the chronological course of my explanatory
narrative, to inform the reader
that, when Lady Ellinor had her interview
with Roland, she had been
repelled by the sternness of his manner
from divulging Vivian's secret. But
on her first attempt to sound or conciliate
him, she had begun with some
eulogies on Trevanion's new friend
and assistant, Mr Gower, and had
awakened Roland's suspicions of
that person's identity with his son&mdash;suspicions
which had given him a
terrible interest in our joint deliverance
of Miss Trevanion. But so
heroically had the poor soldier sought
to resist his own fears, that on the way
he shrank to put to me the questions
that might paralyse the energies which,
whatever the answer, were then so
much needed. "For," said he to my
father, "I felt the blood surging to my
temples; and if I had said to Pisistratus,
'Describe this man,' and by
his description I had recognised my
son, and dreaded lest I might be too
late to arrest him from so treacherous
a crime, my brain would have given
way;&mdash;and so I did not dare!"</p>

<p>I return to the thread of my story.
From the time that Vivian confided in
Lady Ellinor, the way was cleared to
his most ambitious hopes; and though
his acquisitions were not sufficiently
scholastic and various to permit Trevanion
to select him as a secretary,
yet, short of sleeping at the house, he
was little less intimate there than I
had been.</p>

<p>Among Vivian's schemes of advancement,
that of winning the hand
and heart of the great heiress had not
been one of the least sanguine. This
hope was annulled when, not long
after his intimacy at her father's
house, she became engaged to young
Lord Castleton. But he could not
see Miss Trevanion with impunity&mdash;(alas!
who, with a heart yet free,
could be insensible to attractions so
winning?) He permitted the love&mdash;such
love as his wild, half-educated,
half-savage nature acknowledged&mdash;to
creep into his soul&mdash;to master it;
but he felt no hope, cherished no
scheme while the young lord lived.
With the death of her betrothed,
Fanny was free; <i>then</i> he began to
hope&mdash;not yet to scheme. Accidentally
he encountered Peacock. Partly
from the levity that accompanied a
false good-nature that was constitutional
with him, partly from a vague
idea that the man might be useful,
Vivian established his quondam associate
in the service of Trevanion.
Peacock soon gained the secret of
Vivian's love for Fanny, and, dazzled
by the advantages that a marriage
with Miss Trevanion would confer on
his patron, and might reflect on himself,
and delighted at an occasion to
exercise his dramatic accomplishments
on the stage of real life, he soon practised
the lesson that the theatres had
taught him&mdash;viz: to make a sub-intrigue
between maid and valet serve
the schemes and insure the success of
the lover. If Vivian had some opportunities
to imply his admiration,
Miss Trevanion gave him none to
plead his cause. But the softness of
her nature, and that graceful kindness
which surrounded her like an atmosphere,
emanating unconsciously from
a girl's harmless desire to please,
tended to deceive him. His own personal
gifts were so rare, and, in his
wandering life, the effect they had
produced had so increased his reliance
on them, that he thought he wanted
but the fair opportunity to woo in
order to win. In this state of mental
intoxication, Trevanion, having provided
for his Scotch secretary, took
him to Lord N&mdash;&mdash;'s. His hostess
was one of those middle-aged ladies
of fashion, who like to patronise and
bring forward young men, accepting
gratitude for condescension, as a homage
to beauty. She was struck by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Vivian's exterior, and that 'picturesque'
in look and in manner which
belonged to him. Naturally garrulous
and indiscreet, she was unreserved to
a pupil whom she conceived the whim
to make '<i>au fait</i> to society.' Thus
she talked to him, among other topics
in fashion, of Miss Trevanion, and
expressed her belief that the present
Lord Castleton had always admired
her; but it was only on his accession
to the marquisate that he had made
up his mind to marry, or, from his
knowledge of Lady Ellinor's ambition,
thought that the Marquis of
Castleton might achieve the prize
which would have been refused to Sir
Sedley Beaudesert. Then, to corroborate
the predictions she hazarded,
she repeated, perhaps with exaggeration,
some passages from Lord Castleton's
replies to her own suggestions
on the subject. Vivian's alarm became
fatally excited; unregulated
passions easily obscured a reason so
long perverted, and a conscience so
habitually dulled. There is an instinct
in all intense affection, (whether
it be corrupt or pure,) that usually
makes its jealousy prophetic. Thus,
from the first, out of all the brilliant
idlers round Fanny Trevanion, my
jealousy had pre-eminently fastened
on Sir Sedley Beaudesert, though, to
all seeming, without a cause. From
the same instinct, Vivian had conceived
the same vague jealousy&mdash;a
jealousy, in his instance, coupled with
a deep dislike to his supposed rival,
who had wounded his self-love. For
the marquis, though to be haughty or
ill-bred was impossible to the blandness
of his nature, had never shown
to Vivian the genial courtesies he had
lavished upon me, and kept politely
aloof from his acquaintance&mdash;while
Vivian's personal vanity had been
wounded by that drawing-room effect,
which the proverbial winner of all
hearts produced without an effort&mdash;an
effect that threw into the shade the
youth, and the beauty (more striking,
but infinitely less prepossessing) of the
adventurous rival. Thus animosity
to Lord Castleton conspired with
Vivian's passion for Fanny, to rouse
all that was worst by nature and by
rearing, in this audacious and turbulent
spirit.</p>

<p>His confidant, Peacock, suggested
from his stage experience the outlines
of a plot, to which Vivian's
astuter intellect instantly gave tangibility
and colouring. Peacock had
already found Miss Trevanion's waiting-woman
ripe for any measure that
might secure himself as her husband,
and a provision for life as a reward.
Two or three letters between them
settled the preliminary engagements.
A friend of the ex-comedian's had
lately taken an inn on the North road,
and might be relied upon. At that
inn it was settled that Vivian should
meet Miss Trevanion, whom Peacock,
by the aid of the abigail, engaged to
lure there. The sole difficulty that
then remained would, to most men,
have seemed the greatest&mdash;viz., the
consent of Miss Trevanion to a Scotch
marriage. But Vivian hoped all
things from his own eloquence, art,
and passion; and by an inconsistency,
however strange, still not unnatural
in the twists of so crooked an
intellect, he thought that, by insisting
on the intention of her parents to
sacrifice her youth to the very man of
whose attractions he was most jealous&mdash;by
the picture of disparity of years,
by the caricature of his rival's foibles
and frivolities, by the commonplaces
of "beauty bartered for ambition,"
&amp;c., he might enlist her fears of the
alternative on the side of the choice
urged upon her. The plan proceeded,
the time came: Peacock pretended
the excuse of a sick relation to leave
Trevanion; and Vivian, a day before,
on pretence of visiting the picturesque
scenes in the neighbourhood, obtained
leave of absence. Thus the plot went
on to its catastrophe.</p>

<p>"And I need not ask," said I, trying
in vain to conceal my indignation,
"how Miss Trevanion received your
monstrous proposition!"</p>

<p>Vivian's pale cheek grew paler, but
he made no reply.</p>

<p>"And if we had not arrived, what
would you have done? Oh, dare you
look into the gulf of infamy you have
escaped!"</p>

<p>"I cannot, and I will not bear
this!" exclaimed Vivian, starting up.
"I have laid my heart bare before
you, and it is ungenerous and unmanly
thus to press upon its wounds.
You can moralise, you can speak
coldly&mdash;but I&mdash;I loved!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"And do you think," I burst forth&mdash;"do
you think that I did not love
too!&mdash;love longer than you have done;
better than you have done; gone
through sharper struggles, darker
days, more sleepless nights than you,&mdash;and
yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vivian caught hold of me.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he cried; "is this indeed
true! I thought you might have
had some faint and fleeting fancy for
Miss Trevanion, but that you curbed
and conquered it at once. Oh no;
it was impossible to have loved really,
and to have surrendered all chance as
you did!&mdash;have left the house, have
fled from her presence! No&mdash;no,
that was not love!"</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> love! and I pray Heaven
to grant that, one day, you may know
how little your affection sprang from
those feelings which make true love
sublime as honour, and meek as is
religion! Oh cousin, cousin!&mdash;with
those rare gifts, what you might have
been! what, if you will pass through
repentance, and cling to atonement&mdash;what,
I dare hope, you may yet be!
Talk not now of your love; I talk
not of mine! Love is a thing gone
from the lives of both. Go back to
earlier thoughts, to heavier wrongs!&mdash;your
father&mdash;that noble heart which
you have so wantonly lacerated, that
much-enduring love which you have
so little comprehended!"</p>

<p>Then with all the warmth of emotion
I hurried on&mdash;showed him the
true nature of honour and of Roland
(for the names were one!)&mdash;showed
him the watch, the hope, the manly
anguish I had witnessed, and wept&mdash;I,
not his son&mdash;to see; showed him
the poverty and privation to which
the father, even at the last, had condemned
himself, so that the son might
have no excuse for the sins that Want
whispers to the weak. This, and
much more, and I suppose with the
pathos that belongs to all earnestness,
I enforced, sentence after sentence&mdash;yielding
to no interruption, over-mastering
all dissent; driving in the
truth, nail after nail, as it were, into
the obdurate heart, that I constrained
and grappled to. And at last, the
dark, bitter, cynical nature gave way,
and the young man fell sobbing at my
feet, and cried aloud, "Spare me,
spare me!&mdash;I see it all now! Wretch
that I have been!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XCI.</h3>

<p>On leaving Vivian, I did not presume
to promise him Roland's immediate
pardon. I did not urge him to
attempt to see his father. I felt the
time was not come for either pardon
or interview. I contented myself
with the victory I had already gained.
I judged it right that thought, solitude,
and suffering should imprint
more deeply the lesson, and prepare
the way to the steadfast resolution of
reform. I left him seated by the
stream, and with the promise to inform
him at the small hostelry, where he
took up his lodging, how Roland
struggled through his illness.</p>

<p>On returning to the inn, I was
uneasy to see how long a time had
elapsed since I had left my uncle.
But on coming into his room, to my
surprise and relief I found him up and
dressed, and with a serene though
fatigued expression of countenance.
He asked me no questions where I
had been&mdash;perhaps from sympathy
with my feelings in parting with Miss
Trevanion&mdash;perhaps from conjecture
that the indulgence of those feelings
had not wholly engrossed my time.</p>

<p>But he said simply, "I think I
understood from you that you had
sent for Austin&mdash;is it so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I named * * * * *, as
the nearest point to the Tower, for
the place of meeting."</p>

<p>"Then let us go hence forthwith&mdash;nay,
I shall be better for the change.
And here, there must be curiosity,
conjecture&mdash;torture!" said he, locking
his hands tightly together. "Order
the horses at once!"</p>

<p>I left the room, accordingly; and
while they were getting ready the
horses, I ran to the place where I had
left Vivian. He was still there, in
the same attitude, covering his face
with his hands, as if to shut out the
sun. I told him hastily of Roland's
improvement, of our approaching departure,
and asked him an address in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
London at which I could find him.
He gave me as his direction the same
lodging at which I had so often visited
him. "If there be no vacancy there
for me," said he, "I shall leave word
where I am to be found. But I would
gladly be where I was, before&mdash;" He
did not finish the sentence. I pressed
his hand and left him.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XCII.</h3>

<p>Some days have elapsed; we are in
London, my father with us; and
Roland has permitted Austin to tell
me his tale, and received through
Austin all that Vivian's narrative to
me suggested, whether in extenuation
of the past, or in hope of redemption
in the future. And Austin has inexpressibly
soothed his brother. And
Roland's ordinary roughness has gone,
and his looks are meek, and his voice
low. But he talks little, and smiles
never. He asks me no questions;
does not to <i>me</i> name his son, nor
recur to the voyage to Australia, nor
ask 'why it is put off,' nor interest
himself as before in preparations for
it&mdash;he has no heart for anything.</p>

<p>The voyage <i>is</i> put off till the next
vessel sails, and I have seen Vivian
twice or thrice, and the result of the
interviews has disappointed and depressed
me. It seems to me that
much of the previous effect I had produced
is already obliterated. At the
very sight of the great Babel&mdash;the
evidence of the ease, the luxury, the
wealth, the pomp, the strife, the
penury, the famine, and the rags,
which the focus of civilisation, in the
disparities of old societies, inevitably
gathers together&mdash;the fierce combative
disposition seemed to awaken again;
the perverted ambition, the hostility
to the world; the wrath, the scorn;
the war with man, and the rebellious
murmur against Heaven. There was
still the one redeeming point of repentance
for his wrongs to his father&mdash;his
heart was still softened there; and,
attendant on that softness, I hailed a
principle more like that of honour than
I had yet recognised in Vivian. He
cancelled the agreement which had
assured him of a provision at the cost
of his father's comforts. "At least,
there," he said, "I will injure him no
more!"</p>

<p>But while, on this point, repentance
seemed genuine, it was not so with
regard to his conduct towards Miss
Trevanion. His gipsy nurture, his
loose associates, his extravagant
French romances, his theatrical mode
of looking upon love intrigues and
stage plots, seemed all to rise between
his intelligence and the due sense of
the fraud and treachery he had practised.
He seemed to feel more shame
at the exposure than at the guilt;
more despair at the failure of success
than gratitude at escape from crime.
In a word, the nature of a whole life
was not to be remodelled at once&mdash;at
least by an artificer so unskilled as I.</p>

<p>After one of these interviews, I stole
into the room where Austin sat with
Roland, and, watching a seasonable
moment when Roland, shaking off a
reverie, opened his Bible, and sat
down to it, with each muscle in his
face set, as I had seen it before, into
iron resolution, I beckoned my father
from the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;I have again seen
my cousin. I cannot make the way I
wish. My dear father, you must see
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;I!&mdash;yes, assuredly,
if I can be of any service. But will
he listen to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;I think so. A young
man will often respect in his elder,
what he will resent as a presumption
in his contemporary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;It maybe so: (<i>then,
more thoughtfully,</i>) but you describe
this strange boy's mind as a wreck!&mdash;in
what part of the mouldering timbers
can I fix the grappling-hook? Here,
it seems that most of the supports on
which we can best rely, when we would
save another, fail us. Religion, honour,
the associations of childhood,
the bonds of home, filial obedience&mdash;even
the intelligence of self-interest,
in the philosophical sense of the word.
And I, too!&mdash;a mere book-man! My
dear son!&mdash;I despair!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;No, you do not despair&mdash;no,
you must succeed; for, if
you do not, what is to become of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Uncle Roland? Do you not see his
heart is fast breaking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;Get me my hat; I
will go. I will save this Ishmael&mdash;I
will not leave him till he is
saved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span> (<i>some minutes after,
as they are walking towards Vivian's
lodgings.</i>)&mdash;You ask me what support
you are to cling to! A strong and a
good one, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;Ay, what is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Affection! There is
a nature capable of strong affection at
the core of this wild heart! He could
love his mother; tears gush to his
eyes at her name&mdash;he would have
starved rather than part with the
memorial of that love. It was his belief
in his father's indifference or dislike
that hardened and embruted him&mdash;it
is only when he hears how that
father loved him, that I now melt his
pride and curb his passions. You
have affection to deal with!&mdash;do you
despair now?</p>

<p>My father turned on me those eyes
so inexpressibly benign and mild, and
replied softly, "No!"</p>

<p>We reached the house; and my
father said, as we knocked at the
door, "If he is at home, leave me.
This is a hard study to which you
have set me; I must work at it
alone." Vivian was at home, and the
door closed on his visitor. My father
stayed some hours.</p>

<p>On returning home, to my great
surprise I found Trevanion with my
uncle. He had found us out&mdash;no easy
matter, I should think. But a good
impulse in Trevanion was not of that
feeble kind which turns home at the
sight of a difficulty. He had come to
London on purpose to see and to
thank us.</p>

<p>I did not think there had been so
much of delicacy&mdash;of what I may call
the "beauty of kindness"&mdash;in a man
whom incessant business had rendered
ordinarily blunt and abrupt. I hardly
recognised the impatient Trevanion
in the soothing, tender, subtle respect
that rather implied than spoke gratitude,
and sought to insinuate what he
owed to the unhappy father, without
touching on his wrongs from the son.
But of this kindness&mdash;which showed
how Trevanion's high nature of gentleman
raised him aloof from that
coarseness of thought which those
absorbed wholly in practical affairs
often contract&mdash;of this kindness, so
noble and so touching, Roland seemed
scarcely aware. He sat by the embers
of the neglected fire, his hands
grasping the arms of his elbow-chair,
his head drooping on his bosom; and
only by a deep hectic flush on his
dark cheek could you have seen that
he distinguished between an ordinary
visitor and the man whose child he
had helped to save. This minister of
state&mdash;this high member of the elect,
at whose gift are places, peerages,
gold sticks, and ribbons&mdash;has nothing
at his command for the bruised spirit
of the half-pay soldier. Before that
poverty, that grief, and that pride, the
King's Counsellor was powerless.
Only when Trevanion rose to depart,
something like a sense of the soothing
intention which the visit implied
seemed to rouse the repose of the old
man, and to break the ice at its surface;
for he followed Trevanion to the
door, took both his hands, pressed
them, then turned away, and resumed
his seat. Trevanion beckoned to me,
and I followed him down stairs, and
into a little parlour which was unoccupied.</p>

<p>After some remarks upon Roland,
full of deep and considerate feeling,
and one quick, hurried reference to
the son&mdash;to the effect that his guilty
attempt would never be known by the
world&mdash;Trevanion then addressed himself
to me with a warmth and urgency
that took me by surprise. "After
what has passed," he exclaimed, "I
cannot suffer you to leave England
thus. Let me not feel with you, as
with your uncle, that there is nothing
by which I can repay&mdash;no, I will not
so put it. Stay and serve your country
at home: it is my prayer&mdash;it is Ellinor's.
Out of all at my disposal, it
will go hard but what I shall find
something to suit you." And then,
hurrying on, Trevanion spoke flatteringly
of my pretensions, in right of
birth and capabilities, to honourable
employment, and placed before me a
picture of public life&mdash;its prizes and
distinctions&mdash;which, for the moment
at least, made my heart beat loud and
my breath come quick. But still,
even then, I felt (was it an unreasonable
pride?) that there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
that jarred, something that humbled,
in the thought of holding all my fortunes
as a dependency on the father
of the woman I loved, but might not
aspire to;&mdash;something even of personal
degradation in the mere feeling
that I was thus to be repaid for a
service, and recompensed for a loss.
But these were not reasons I could
advance; and, indeed, so for the time
did Trevanion's generosity and eloquence
overpower me, that I could
only falter out my thanks, and my promise
that I would consider and let him
know.</p>

<p>With that promise he was forced to
content himself; he told me to direct
to him at his favourite country-seat,
whither he was going that day, and
so left me. I looked round the humble
parlour of the mean lodging-house,
and Trevanion's words came again
before me like a flash of golden light.
I stole into the open air, and wandered
through the crowded streets,
agitated and disturbed.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XCIII.</h3>

<p>Several days elapsed&mdash;and of each
day my father spent a considerable
part at Vivian's lodgings. But he
maintained a reserve as to his success,
begged me not to question him, and
to refrain also for the present from
visiting my cousin. My uncle guessed
or knew his brother's mission; for I
observed that, whenever Austin went
noiseless away, his eye brightened,
and the colour rose in a hectic flush
to his cheek. At last my father came
to me one morning, his carpet-bag in
his hand, and said, "I am going
away for a week or two. Keep Roland
company till I return."</p>

<p>"Going with <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"With him."</p>

<p>"That is a good sign."</p>

<p>"I hope so; that is all I can say
now."</p>

<p>The week had not quite passed
when I received from my father the
letter I am about to place before the
reader; and you may judge how earnestly
his soul must have been in the
task it had volunteered, if you observe
how little, comparatively speaking, the
letter contains of the subtleties and
pedantries (may the last word be pardoned,
for it is scarcely a just one)
which ordinarily left my father a
scholar even in the midst of his emotions.
He seemed here to have abandoned
his books, to have put the
human heart before the eyes of his
pupil, and said, "Read, and <i>un</i>learn!"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Pisistratus Caxton.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Son</span>,&mdash;It were needless
to tell you all the earlier difficulties
I have had to encounter with my
charge, nor to repeat all the means
which, acting on your suggestion, (a
correct one,) I have employed to
arouse feelings long dormant and confused,
and allay others, long prematurely
active, and terribly distinct.
The evil was simply this: here was
the intelligence of a man in all that
is evil&mdash;and the ignorance of an infant
in all that is good. In matters
merely worldly, what wonderful acumen!
in the plain principles of right
and wrong, what gross and stolid
obtuseness! At one time, I am straining
all my poor wit to grapple in an
encounter on the knottiest mysteries
of social life; at another, I am guiding
reluctant fingers over the horn-book
of the most obvious morals.
Here hieroglyphics, and there pot-hooks!
But as long as there is affection
in a man, why, there is Nature
to begin with! To get rid of all the
rubbish laid upon her, clear back the
way to that Nature, and start afresh&mdash;that
is one's only chance.</p>

<p>"Well, by degrees I won my way,
waiting patiently till the bosom,
pleased with the relief, disgorged itself
of all 'its perilous stuff,'&mdash;not chiding&mdash;not
even remonstrating, seeming
almost to sympathise, till I got him Socratically
to disprove himself. When
I saw that he no longer feared me&mdash;that
my company had become a relief
to him&mdash;I proposed an excursion, and
did not tell him whither.</p>

<p>"Avoiding as much as possible the
main north road, (for I did not wish,
as you may suppose, to set fire to a
train of associations that might blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
us up to the dog-star,) and, where that
avoidance was not possible, travelling
by night, I got him into the neighbourhood
of the old Tower. I would
not admit him under its roof. But
you know the little inn, three miles
off the trout stream?&mdash;we made our
abode there.</p>

<p>"Well, I have taken him into the
village, preserving his incognito. I
have entered with him into cottages,
and turned the talk upon Roland.
You know how your uncle is adored;
you know what anecdotes of his bold,
warm-hearted youth once, and now
of his kind and charitable age, would
spring up from the garrulous lips of
gratitude! I made him see with his
own eyes, hear with his own ears,
how all who knew Roland loved and
honoured him&mdash;except his son. Then
I took him round the ruins&mdash;(still not
suffering him to enter the house,) for
those ruins are the key to Roland's
character&mdash;seeing them, one sees the
pathos in his poor foible of family
pride. There, you distinguish it from
the insolent boasts of the prosperous,
and feel that it is little more than the
pious reverence to the dead&mdash;'the
tender culture of the tomb.' We sat
down on heaps of mouldering stone,
and it was there that I explained to
him what Roland was in youth, and
what he had dreamed that a son
would be to him. I showed him the
graves of his ancestors, and explained
to him why they were sacred in Roland's
eyes! I had gained a great
way, when he longed to enter the
home that should have been his; and
I could make him pause of his own
accord, and say, 'No, I must first be
worthy of it.' Then you would have
smiled&mdash;sly satirist that you are&mdash;to
have heard me impressing upon this
acute, sharp-witted youth, all that we
plain folk understand by the name of
HOME&mdash;its perfect trust and truth, its
simple holiness, its exquisite happiness&mdash;being
to the world what conscience
is to the human mind. And
after that, I brought in his sister,
whom till then he had scarcely named&mdash;for
whom he scarcely seemed to
care&mdash;brought her in to aid the
father, and endear the home. 'And
you know,' said I, 'that if Roland
were to die, it would be a brother's
duty to supply his place; to shield her
innocence&mdash;to protect her name! A
good name is something, then. Your
father was not so wrong to prize it.
You would like yours to be that which
your sister would be proud to own!'</p>

<p>"While we were talking, Blanche
suddenly came to the spot, and rushed
to my arms. She looked on him as a
stranger; but I saw his knees tremble.
And then she was about to put
her hand in his&mdash;but I drew her back.
Was I cruel? He thought so. But
when I dismissed her, I replied to his
reproach, 'Your sister is a part of
Home. If you think yourself worthy
of either, go and claim both; I will
not object.'&mdash;'She has my mother's
eyes,' said he, and walked away. I
left him to muse amidst the ruins,
while I went in to see your poor
mother, and relieve her fears about
Roland, and make her understand
why I could not yet return <i>home</i>.</p>

<p>"This brief sight of his sister has
sunk deep into him. But I now approach
what seems to me the great
difficulty of the whole. He is fully
anxious to redeem his name&mdash;to regain
his home. So far so well. But
he cannot yet see ambition, except
with hard, worldly eyes. He still
fancies that all he has to do is to get
money and power, and some of those
empty prizes in the Great Lottery,
which we often win more easily by
our sins than our virtues. (Here
follows a long passage from Seneca,
omitted as superfluous.) He does not
yet even understand me&mdash;or, if he does,
he fancies me a mere bookworm indeed,
when I imply that he might be
poor, and obscure, at the bottom of
fortune's wheel, and yet be one we
should be proud of! He supposes
that, to redeem his name, he has only
got to lacker it. Don't think me
merely the fond father, when I add
my hope that I shall use you to advantage
here. I mean to talk to him
to-morrow, as we return to London,
of you, and of your ambition: you
shall hear the result.</p>

<p>"At this moment, (it is past midnight,)
I hear his step in the room
above me. The window-sash aloft
opens&mdash;for the third time; would
to Heaven he could read the true
astrology of the stars! There they
are&mdash;bright, luminous, benignant.
And I seeking to chain this wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ing
comet into the harmonies of heaven!
Better task than that of astrologers,
and astronomers to boot! Who
among them can 'loosen the band of
Orion?'&mdash;but who amongst us may
not be permitted by God to have sway
over the action and orbit of the
human soul?</p>

<p>"Your ever affectionate father,</p></blockquote>

A. C."<br />
</p>

<p>Two days after the receipt of this
letter, came the following; and though
I would fain suppress those references
to myself which must be ascribed to a
father's partiality, yet it is so needful
to retain them in connexion with
Vivian, that I have no choice but to
leave the tender flatteries to the indulgence
of the kind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Son</span>,&mdash;I was not too
sanguine as to the effect that your
simple story would produce upon your
cousin. Without implying any contrast
to his own conduct, I described
that scene in which you threw yourself
upon our sympathy, in the struggle
between love and duty, and asked for
our counsel and support; when Roland
gave you his blunt advice to tell
all to Trevanion; and when, amidst
such sorrow as the heart in youth
seems scarcely large enough to hold,
you caught at truth impulsively, and
the truth bore you safe from the shipwreck.
I recounted your silent and
manly struggles&mdash;your resolution not
to suffer the egotism of passion to
unfit you for the aims and ends of
that spiritual probation which we call
<span class="smcap">LIFE</span>. I showed you as you were,
still thoughtful for us, interested in
our interests&mdash;smiling on us, that we
might not guess that you wept in
secret! Oh, my son&mdash;my son! do
not think that, in those times, I did
not feel and pray for you! And while
he was melted by my own emotion,
I turned from your love to your ambition.
I made him see that you,
too, had known the restlessness which
belongs to young ardent natures; that
you, too, had your dreams of fortune,
and aspirations for success. But I
painted that ambition in its true
colours: it was not the desire of a selfish
intellect, to be in yourself a somebody&mdash;a
something&mdash;raised a step or
two in the social ladder, for the pleasure
of looking down on those at the foot,
but the warmer yearning of a generous
heart; your ambition was to repair
your father's losses&mdash;minister to your
father's very foible, in <i>his</i> idle desire
of fame&mdash;supply to your uncle what
he had lost in his natural heir&mdash;link
your success to useful objects, your
interests to those of your kind, your
reward to the proud and grateful
smiles of those you loved. That was
thine ambition, O my tender Anachronism!
And when, as I closed the
sketch, I said, 'Pardon me: you
know not what delight a father feels,
when, while sending a son away from
him into the world, he can speak and
think thus of him! But this, you
see, is not your kind of ambition.
Let us talk of making money, and
driving a coach-and-four through this
villanous world,'&mdash;your cousin sank
into a profound reverie, and when he
woke from it, it was like the waking of
the earth after a night in spring&mdash;the
bare trees had put forth buds!</p>

<p>"And, some time after, he startled
me by a prayer that I would permit
him, with his father's consent, to
accompany you to Australia. The
only answer I have given him as
yet, has been in the form of a question:
'Ask yourself if I ought? I
cannot wish Pisistratus to be other
than he is; and unless you agree with
him in all his principles and objects,
ought I to incur the risk that you
should give him your knowledge of the
world, and inoculate him with your
ambition?' He was struck, and had
the candour to attempt no reply.</p>

<p>"Now, Pisistratus, the doubt I
expressed to him is the doubt I feel.
For, indeed, it is only by home-truths,
not refining arguments, that I can
deal with this unscholastic Scythian,
who, fresh from the Steppes, comes to
puzzle me in the Portico.</p>

<p>"On the one hand, what is to become
of him in the Old World? At
his age, and with his energies, it
would be impossible to cage him with
us in the Cumberland ruins; weariness
and discontent would undo all
we could do. He has no resource in
books&mdash;and I fear never will have!
But to send him forth into one of the
overcrowded professions&mdash;to place
him amidst all those 'disparities of
social life,' on the rough stones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
which he is perpetually grinding his
heart&mdash;turn him adrift amongst all
the temptations to which he is most
prone&mdash;this is a trial which, I fear,
will be too sharp for a conversion so
incomplete. In the New World, no
doubt, his energies would find a safer
field; and even the adventurous and
desultory habits of his childhood might
there be put to healthful account.
Those complaints of the disparities of
the civilised world, find, I suspect, an
easier if a bluffer reply from the political
economist than the Stoic philosopher.
'You don't like them, you
find it hard to submit to them,' says
the political economist; 'but they
are the laws of a civilised state, and
you can't alter them. Wiser men
than you have tried to alter them,
and never succeeded, though they
turned the earth topsy-turvy! Very
well; but the world is wide&mdash;go into
a state that is not so civilised. The
disparities of the Old World vanish
amidst the New! Emigration is the
reply of Nature to the rebellious cry
against Art.' Thus would say the
political economist: and, alas, even
in your case, my son, I found no reply
to the reasonings! I acknowledge,
then, that Australia might open the
best safety-valve to your cousin's
discontent and desires; but I acknowledge
also a counter-truth, which is
this&mdash;'It is not permitted to an honest
man to corrupt himself for the sake
of others.' That is almost the only
maxim of Jean Jacques to which I
can cheerfully subscribe! Do you
feel quite strong enough to resist
all the influences which a companionship
of this kind may subject
you to&mdash;strong enough to bear his
burthen as well as your own&mdash;strong
enough, also&mdash;ay, and alert and vigilant
enough&mdash;to prevent those influences
harming the others, whom you
have undertaken to guide, and whose
lots are confided to you? Pause well,
and consider maturely, for this must
not depend upon a generous impulse.
I think that your cousin would now
pass under your charge, with a sincere
desire for reform; but between
sincere desire and steadfast performance
there is a long and dreary interval&mdash;even
to the best of us. Were it
not for Roland, and had I one grain
less confidence in you, I could not
entertain the thought of laying on
your young shoulders so great a
responsibility. But every new responsibility
to an earliest nature is a
new prop to virtue;&mdash;and all I now
ask of you is&mdash;to remember that it <i>is</i>
a solemn and serious charge, not to be
undertaken without the most deliberate
gauge and measure of the strength
with which it is to be borne.</p>

<p>"In two days we shall be in
London.&mdash;Yours, my Anachronism,
anxiously and fondly,</p></blockquote>

<p>
A. C."<br />
</p>

<p>I was in my own room while I
read this letter, and I had just finished
it when, as I looked up, I saw Roland
standing opposite to me. "It is from
Austin," said he; then he paused a
moment, and added in a tone that
seemed quite humble, "May I see it?&mdash;and
dare I?" I placed the letter
in his hands, and retired a few paces,
that he might not think I watched his
countenance while he read it. And I
was only aware that he had come to
the end by a heavy, anxious, but not
despondent sigh. Then I turned,
and our eyes met, and there was
something in Roland's look, inquiring&mdash;and
as it were imploring. I interpreted
it at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, uncle," I said, smiling;
"I have reflected, and I have no fear
of the result. Before my father
wrote, what he now suggests had
become my secret wish. As for our
other companions, their simple natures
would defy all such sophistries
as&mdash;but he is already half cured of
those. Let him come with me, and
when he returns he shall be worthy
of a place in your heart, beside his
sister Blanche. I feel, I promise it&mdash;do
not fear for me! Such a change
will be a talisman to myself. I will
shun every error that I might otherwise
commit, so that he may have no
example to entice him to err."</p>

<p>I know that in youth, and the superstition
of first love, we are credulously
inclined to believe that love, and the
possession of the beloved, are the
only happiness. But when my uncle
folded me in his arms, and called me
the hope of his age, and stay of his
house&mdash;the music of my father's
praise still ringing on my heart&mdash;I do
affirm that I knew a greater and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
prouder bliss than if Trevanion had
placed Fanny's hand in mine, and
said, "She is yours."</p>

<p>And now the die was cast&mdash;the
decision made. It was with no regret
that I wrote to Trevanion to decline
his offers. Nor was the sacrifice so
great&mdash;even putting aside the natural
pride which had before inclined to it&mdash;as
it may seem to some; for, restless
though I was, I had laboured to
constrain myself to other views of
life than those which close the vistas
of ambition with images of the terrestrial
deities&mdash;Power and Rank. Had
I not been behind the scenes, noted
all of joy and of peace that the pursuit
of power had cost Trevanion,
and seen how little of happiness rank
gave even to one of the polished
habits and graceful attributes of Lord
Castleton? Yet each nature seemed
fitted so well&mdash;the first for power, the
last for rank! It is marvellous with
what liberality Providence atones for
the partial dispensations of Fortune.
Independence, or the vigorous pursuit
of it; affection, with its hopes and its
rewards; a life only rendered by art
more susceptible to nature&mdash;in which
the physical enjoyments are pure and
healthful&mdash;in which the moral faculties
expand harmoniously with the
intellectual&mdash;and the heart is at peace
with the mind: is this a mean lot for
ambition to desire&mdash;and is it so far
out of human reach? "Know thyself,"
said the old philosophy. "Improve
thyself," saith the new. The
great object of the Sojourner in Time
is not to waste all his passions and
gifts on the things external that he
must leave behind&mdash;that which he
cultivates within is all that he can
carry into the Eternal Progress. We
are here but as schoolboys, whose life
begins where school ends; and the
battles we fought with our rivals, and
the toys that we shared with our
playmates, and the names that we
carved, high or low, on the wall,
above our desks&mdash;will they so much
bestead us hereafter? As new facts
crowd upon us, can they more than
pass through the memory with a smile
or a sigh? Look back to thy school
days, and answer.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XCIV.</h3>

<p>Two weeks, since the date of the
preceding chapter, have passed; we
have slept our last, for long years to
come, on the English soil. It is
night; and Vivian has been admitted
to an interview with his father. They
have been together alone an hour and
more, and I and my father will not
disturb them. But the clock strikes&mdash;the
hour is late&mdash;the ship sails
to-night&mdash;we should be on board.
And as we two stand below, the door
opens in the room above, and a heavy
step descends the stairs; the father
is leaning on the son's arm. You
should see how timidly the son guides
the halting step. And now, as the
light gleams on their faces, there are
tears on Vivian's cheek; but the face
of Roland seems calm and happy.
Happy! when about to be separated,
perhaps for ever, from his son? Yes,
happy! because he has found a son
for the first time; and is not thinking
of years and absence, and the chance
of death&mdash;but thankful for the Divine
mercy, and cherishing celestial hope.
If ye wonder why Roland is happy in
such an hour, how vainly have I
sought to make him breathe, and
live, and move before you!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are on board; our luggage all
went first. I had had time, with the
help of a carpenter, to knock up
cabins for Vivian, Guy Bolding, and
myself in the hold. For, thinking we
could not too soon lay aside the pretensions
of Europe&mdash;"<i>de</i>-fine-gentlemanise"
ourselves, as Trevanion recommended&mdash;we
had engaged steerage
passage, to the great humouring of
our finances. We had, too, the
luxury to be by ourselves, and our
own Cumberland folks were round
us, as our friends and servants both.</p>

<p>We are on board, and have looked
our last on those we are to leave, and
we stand on deck leaning on each
other. We are on board, and the
lights, near and far, shine from the
vast city; and the stars are on high,
bright and clear, as for the first mariners
of old. Strange noises, rough
voices, and crackling cords, and here
and there the sobs of women, mingling
with the oaths of men. Now
the swing and heave of the vessel&mdash;the
dreary sense of exile that comes
when the ship fairly moves over the
waters. And still we stood, and
looked, and listened; silent, and leaning
on each other.</p>

<p>Night deepened, the city vanished&mdash;not
a gleam from its myriad lights!
The river widened and widened. How
cold comes the wind!&mdash;is that a gale
from the sea? The stars grow faint&mdash;the
moon has sunk. And now, how
desolate look the waters in the comfortless
gray of dawn! Then we
shivered and looked at each other,
and muttered something that was not
the thought deepest at our hearts,
and crept into our berths&mdash;feeling
sure it was not for sleep. And sleep
came on us soft and kind. The ocean
lulled the exiles as on a mother's
breast.</p>

<p>A new school of novelists is evidently
springing up on the western
shores of the Atlantic. The pioneers
are already in the field&mdash;and the main
body, we suppose, will shortly follow.
The style of these innovators seems a
compound imitation of <i>Gulliver</i>, <i>Munchausen</i>,
<i>The Arabian Nights</i>, and <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>; the ingredients being
mixed in capricious proportions, well
stirred, seasoned with Yankee bulls
and scraps of sea-slang, and served
hot&mdash;sometimes plain, at others with
a <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i> of puffs. We know not
how such queer ragouts affect the
public palate; but we are inclined to
prefer dishes of an older fashion. Mr
Herman Melville, of New York and
the Pacific Ocean, common sailor, first
introduced the new-fangled kickshaw.
This young gentleman has most completely
disappointed us. Two or three
years ago, he published two small
volumes of sea-faring adventure and
island-rambles, of which we thought
more highly than of any first appearance
of the kind we for a long time
had witnessed. In the pages of Maga,
where praise is never lightly or lavishly
bestowed, we said as much; and were
glad to hope that Typee and Omoo
were but an earnest of even better
things. And, therefore, sadly were we
disgusted on perusal of a rubbishing
rhapsody, entitled <i>Mardi, and a Voyage
Thither</i>. We sat down to it with glee
and self-gratulation, and through
about half a volume we got on pleasantly
enough. The author was afloat;
and although we found little that
would bear comparison with the fine
vein of nautical fun and characteristic
delineation which we had enjoyed on
board the Little Jule, and afterwards
at Tahiti, yet there was interest&mdash;strong
interest at times; and a
scene on board a deserted vessel was
particularly exciting,&mdash;replete with
power of a peculiar and uncommon
kind. But this proved a mere flash
in the pan&mdash;the ascent of the rocket
which was soon to fall as a stick. An
outlandish young female, one Miss
Yillah, makes her first appearance:
Taji, the hero and narrator of the
yarn, reaches a cluster of fabulous
islands, where the jealous queen Hautia
opens a floral correspondence with
him: where the plumed and turbaned
Yoomy sings indifferent doggerel; and
Philosopher Babbalanja unceasingly
doth prose; and the Begum of Pimminee
holds drawing-rooms, which are
attended by the Fanfums, and the
Diddledees, and the Fiddlefies, and a
host of other insular magnates, with
names equally elegant, euphonious,
and significant. Why, what trash is
all this!&mdash;mingled, too, with attempts
at a Rabelaisian vein, and with strainings
at smartness&mdash;the style of the
whole being affected, pedantic, and
wearisome exceedingly. We are reminded,
by certain parts of <i>Mardi</i>, of
Foote's nonsense about the nameless
lady who "went into the garden to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie;"
and at whose wedding the Joblilies,
and the Picninnies, and the
Great Panjandrum, danced till the
gunpowder ran out at their boot-heels.
Foote wrote his absurd paragraph, we
believe, to try a friend's memory; Mr
Melville has evidently written his unintelligible
novel to try the public's
patience. Of three things we are certain,
namely, that the Panjandrum
story is quite as easy to understand as
<i>Mardi</i>; that it is much more diverting;
and, the chief advantage of all,
an infinite deal shorter.</p>

<p><i>Mardi</i>, which we dismissed from
our mind when we closed it with a
yawn a day or two after its publication,
has been recalled to our memory
by another book, also proceeding from
America, although published in London;
and which, like Mr Melville's
romance, blends the real and the possible
with the ideal and the fantastic.
<i>Kaloolah</i> (Heaven help these Yankee
nomenclators) professes to be the
autobiography of Jonathan Romer, a
young Nantucket sailor, to whose
narrative, during his absence in the
interior of Africa, one of his countrymen,
Dr W. S. Mayo, obligingly acts
as editor. Most readers will probably
be of opinion that the American M.D.
might claim a nearer interest in the
literary bantling&mdash;the first-born, we
apprehend, of his own pen and imagination.
But our business is with
the book, and not with the author,
whose name, whether Romer or Mayo,
is as yet unknown to fame, but who
need not despair of achieving reputation.
<i>Kaloolah</i> combines with certain
faults, which may presently be indicated,
some very excellent qualities,
and has several chapters, whereof any
one contains more real good stuff, and
ingenuity, and amusement, than the
whole of the second and third volumes
of <i>Mardi</i>, reduced to a concentrated
essence. Besides, it is manifest that
the two books must be viewed and
judged differently&mdash;one as a first, and
by no means unpromising attempt;
the other, as the backsliding performance
of a man who has proved himself
capable of far better things.</p>

<p>Before commencing his own story,
young Jonathan Romer introduces us
to his ancestors, and asserts his right
to a life of adventure. "Descended
on both sides of the house from some
of the earliest settlers of Nantucket,
and more or less intimately related to
the Coffins, the Folgers, the Macys,
and the Starbucks of that adventurous
population, it would seem that I had
a natural right to a roving disposition,
and to a life of peril, privation, and
vicissitude. Nearly all the male members
of my family, for several generations,
have been followers of the
sea: some of them in the calm and
peaceful employment of the merchant-service;
others, and by far the greater
number, in the more dangerous pursuit
of the ocean monster." After relating
some of the feats of his family,
and glancing at his own childhood,
which gave early indications of the
bold and restless spirit that animated
him at a mature period, Jonathan
presents himself to his readers at the
age of eighteen&mdash;a stalwart stripling
and idle student; the best rider, shot,
swimmer, and leaper for many miles
around, with little taste for books, and
a very decided one for rambling in the
woods with rifle and rod. At this
time the academy, of which he had
for four years been an inmate, is nearly
broken up by what is called "a revival
of religion;" in other words, a
violent fit of fanatical enthusiasm,
provoked and fed by Baptist and Methodist
preachers. Pupils and teachers
alike go mad with fervent zeal, classes
are at an end, unceasing prayer is substituted
for study, and Jonathan, who
ls one of the few unregenerated, walks
into the forest, and knocks the head
off a partridge with a rifle-ball. The
bird is picked up, and the excellence
of the aim applauded by an old trapper
and hunter, Joe Downs by name, well
known along the shores of the Rackett
and Grass rivers, in the northern and
uninhabited part of the state of New
York. Joe is not the wild, semi-Indian
trapper of the south and west,
whom Sealsfield and Ruxton have so
graphically sketched; there is as much
difference between the two characters
as between a sailor in the coasting
trade and a Pacific Ocean beachcomber.
There is nothing of the half-horse,
half-alligator style about Joe,
whose manner is so mild, and his coat
so decent, that he has been taken for
a country parson. He despises the
Redskins, sets no value on their scalps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and would not shed their blood, except
in self-defence. How he had
once been thus compelled to do so,
he relates to Jonathan in the course
of their first conversation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was the way towards Tupper's
lake. There had been a light fall of snow,
and I was scouting round, when I happened
to make a circumbendibus, and
came across my own track, and there I
saw the marks of an Indian's foot right
on my trail. Thinks I, that is kind of
queer; the fellow must have been following
me; howsomever I'll try him, and
make sure; so I made another large
circle, and again struck my own track,
and there was the tarnal Indian's foot
again. Says I, this won't do; I must find
out what this customer wants, and how
he'll have it. So I stopped short, and soon
got sight of him; he knew that I saw him,
so he came along up, in the most friendly
manner you can think. But I didn't like
his looks; he was altogether too darned
glad to see me. He had no gun, but he
had an almighty long-handled tomahawk,
and a lot of skins and real traps. Thinks
I, may be, old fellow, your gun has burst,
or you've pawned it for rum, and you
can't raise skins enough to redeem it,
and you want mine, and perhaps you'll
get it.</p>

<p>"At last I grew kind of nervous; I
knew the fellow would hatchet me if I
gave him a chance, and yet I didn't want
to shoot him right down just on suspicion.
But I thought, if I let him cut my throat
first, it would be too late to shoot him
afterwards. So I concluded that the best
way would be to give him a chance to
play his hand; and if so be he'd lead the
wrong card, why I should have a right to
take the trick. Just then, at the right
time, a partridge flew into a clump that
stood five or six rods off. So I kind of
'n&oelig;uvred round a little. I drew out my
ramrod, as if to feel whether the ball in
my rifle was well down; but instead of
returning it again, I kept it in my hand,
and, without letting the vagabond see me,
I got out a handful of powder. I then
sauntered off to the bush, shot the partridge,
and in an instant passed my hand
over the muzzle of my rifle, and dropped
the powder in. I picked up the bird, and
then just took and run my ramrod right
down upon the powder. Now, he thought,
was his chance before I loaded my gun
again. He came towards me with his
hatchet in his hand. I saw that he was
determined to act wicked, and began to
back off; he still came on. I lowered my
rifle, and told him to keep away. He
raised his tomahawk, gave one yell, and
bounded right at me. When he was just
about three or four feet from the muzzle,
I fired. You never see a fellow jump so.
He kicked his heels up in the air, and
came down plump on his head, dead as
Julius C&aelig;sar. He never winked; the
ramrod&mdash;a good, hard, tough piece of hickory&mdash;had
gone clean through him, and
stuck out about two feet from his back.
Served him right; didn't it?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The old trapper urges Jonathan to
accompany him on an expedition into
the woods, promising, as an inducement,
to put him "right alongside the
biggest catamount he has ever seen,"
and to let him fight it out, with rifle,
hatchet, and knife, without making
or meddling in the contest. He also
pledges himself to show him a fishpond,
"where the youngest infants,
of a genteel pickerelto family, weigh
at least three pounds." Such inducements
are irresistible. Jonathan packs
up a brace of blankets and his shooting
and fishing fixings, and goes off
in the canoe with Joe Downs on a
pleasant up-stream cruise, enlivened
by a succession of beautiful scenery,
and by the varied and original conversation
of his companion. On their
way they fell in with a party of Indians,
amongst them one Blacksnake,
a brother of the gentleman whom
Joe had spitted on his ramrod. He
suspects Joe of having shot his kinsman,
and Joe strongly suspects him
of having already attempted to revenge
his death.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I was leaning out of the second story
doorway of Jones's shop one day,' said
Joe, 'looking across the river, when,
whizz, a rifle bullet came and buried itself
in the doorpost. I hain't the least
doubt that that very identical Blacksnake
sent it. Thank God, his aim was not as
his will! He's a bad chap. Why, I
really believe it was he who murdered
my old friend Dan White the trapper.
If I only knew it was the fact, I wish I
may be stuck, forked end uppermost, in a
coon hole, if I wouldn't send a ball
through his painted old braincase, this 'ere
very identical minute. Darn your skin!'
energetically growled Joe, shaking his
fist at the distant canoe."</p></blockquote>

<p>It would have saved Mr Downs
some trouble and suffering if he had
yielded to the impulse, and expended
half-an-ounce of lead upon Blacksnake,
who, about a week later,
sneaks up, with two companions, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the trapper's pine-log fire, and shoots
the unfortunate Joe, but is shot down
himself, the very next moment, by
Jonathan Romer, whose double-barrel
settles two of the murderers, and then
descends with crushing force upon the
cranium of the third. Joe not being
dead, although very badly wounded,
his young companion conveys him to
a cave, whose hidden entrance the
trapper had revealed to him the previous
day, and there tends him till he
is able to bear removal. With his
committal to the hands of a village
surgeon, Mr Romer's backwoods adventures
terminate, a source of regret
to the reader, since they are more
lively and attractive than some subsequent
portions of the book, evidently
deemed by the author more interesting
and important, and therefore
dwelt upon at greater length. Indeed
it is our opinion that the author of
<i>Kaloolah</i> is mistaken, as young authors
constantly are, in the real scope
and nature of his own abilities, and
that he would shine much more in a
novel of backwoods life, or nautical
adventure, than in the mixed style he
has selected for his first attempt,
which is a sort of mosaic, distinguished
rather for variety and vividness of
colour than for harmony and regularity
of design.</p>

<p>Jonathan reaches home in time to
receive the last adieu of his mother, a
worthy but eccentric old lady, who
had fitted out her son, on his departure
for school, with a winding-sheet,
amongst other necessaries, that he
might be buried decently should he
die far from his friends, and that he
might be reminded of his mortality as
often as he emptied his trunk. It was
a curious conceit, but, as Jonathan
observes, she was from Nantucket,
and they are all queer people there,
and filial affection induced him long
to preserve the shroud. Mrs Romer
dead, her son applies to the study of
surgery, gets himself into trouble by
a body-snatching exploit, has to
levant to New York, and there, finding
he is still in danger from the
friends of the disinterred corpse, who
have set the police upon his track,
ships himself on board the fine fore-topsail
schooner, "Lively Anne,"
bound for the Western Islands, and
commanded by Captain Coffin, an old
shipmate of his father's. In this
smart little craft, he sees some country
and more water, until, upon the
voyage from the Azores to Malaga, a
white squall or a waterspout&mdash;which
of the two he could never ascertain&mdash;capsizes
the schooner and dashes him
senseless down the hatchway, whence
he was just emerging, in alarm at the
sudden uproar on deck. On recovering
himself, he finds the vessel dismasted,
the deck swept of all its fixtures,
and the captain and crew
missing. Doubtless they had been
hurled into the waves by the same
terrible force that had shattered the
bulwarks and carried away boats,
casks, and galley. The horizon was
now clear, not a sail was in sight, and
Jonathan Romer was alone on a
helpless wreck in the middle of the
wide ocean. But he was a man of
resource and mettle, whom it was
hard to discourage or intimidate; and
finding the schooner made no water,
he righted her as well as he could, and
resigned himself to float at the will of
the wind until he should meet a rescuing
sail. This did not occur for some
weeks, during which he floated past
Teneriffe in the night, within hail of
fishermen, who would not approach
him for fear of the quarantine laws.
At last, sitting over his solitary dinner,
he perceived a ship heading up
for the schooner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As she came on, I had full time to
note all her beautiful proportions. She
was small, apparently not above 300
tons, and had a peculiarly trim and
clipper-like look. Her bright copper,
flashing occasionally in the sunlight,
showed that she was in light sailing
trim; whilst from the cut of her sails,
the symmetrical arrangement of her spars
and rigging, and her quarter-boats, I
concluded she must be a man-of-war.
Passing me about half a mile astern, she
stood on for a little distance, then, hoisting
the bilious-looking flag of Spain, she
tacked and ran for me, backing her
main-topsail within twenty yards of my
larboard beam. Her quarter-boat was
immediately lowered, and half-a-dozen
fellows, in red caps and flannel shirts,
jumped into it, followed by an officer in
a blue velvet jacket, with a strip of gold
lace upon his shoulders, and a broad-brimmed
straw hat upon his head. I ran
below, stuffed all the money that I had
in gold&mdash;about a thousand dollars&mdash;into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
my pockets, and got upon deck again just
as the boat touched the side."</p></blockquote>

<p>The precaution was a good one:
the saucy Bonito, Pedro Garbez
master, was bound from Cuba to the
coast of Africa, with a cut-throat
crew and an empty slave-deck.
Owing to an accident, she had sailed
without a surgeon, and Romer was
well received and treated so soon as
his profession was known. When he
discovered the ship's character, he
would gladly have left her, but means
were wanting, for the Bonito loved
not intercourse with passing craft,
and touched nowhere until she reached
her destination&mdash;Cabenda Bay, on
the western coast of Africa. There
being no slaves at Cabenda, it was
resolved to run a few miles up the
Congo river.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We at length reached Loonbee, and
anchored off the town, which is the chief
market or slave-depot for Embomma. It
consists of about a hundred huts of palm-leaves,
with two or three block-houses,
where the slaves are confined. About
two hundred slaves were already collected,
and more were on their way down
the river, and from different towns in the
interior. After presents for the King of
Embomma, and for the Mafooka (a sort
of chief of the board of slave-trade,) and
other officials, had been made, and a deal
of brandy drunk, we landed, and in company
with several Fukas, or native merchants,
and two or three Portuguese,
went to take a look at the slaves. Each
dealer paraded his gang for inspection,
and loudly dilated upon their respective
qualities. They were all entirely naked,
and of all ages, sexes, and conditions, and
all had an air of stolid indifference, varied
only in some of them by an expression
of surprise and fear at sight of the
white men."</p></blockquote>

<p>In one of these unfortunate groups
of dingy humanity, Romer was struck
by the appearance of a young girl,
whose features widely differed from
the usual African stamp, and whose
complexion, amongst a white population,
would not have been deemed
too dark for a brunette. Her gracefully
curling hair contrasted with the
woolly polls of her companions; her
eyes were large and expressive, and
her form elegant, but then emaciated
by fatigue and ill-treatment. This is
Kaloolah. On inquiry of the slave-dealer,
a great burly negro, wielding
a long thong of plaited buffalo hide,
Romer learned that she is of a far
distant nation, called the Gerboo
Blanda, who dwell in stone houses on
an extensive plain. The slave-dealer
knows them only by report, and Kaloolah
and her brother, who is near at
hand, are the first specimens he has
seen of this remote tribe. He had
bought her two months' journey off,
and then she had already come a long
distance. And now that he had got
them to the coast, he esteems them
of small value compared to the full-blooded
blacks; for Kaloolah has pined
herself away to a shadow, and her brother,
Enphadde, is bent upon suicide,
and cannot be trusted with unfettered
hands; so that for thirty dollars
Romer buys them both. The Bonito
having been driven out to sea by the
approach of a British cruiser, he
passes some days on shore with
his new purchases; during which
time, with a rapidity bordering on
the miraculous, he acquires sufficient
of their language, and they of his, to
carry on a sort of piebald conversation,
to learn the history of these pale
Africans, and some particulars of their
mysterious country.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Gerboo Blanda, I found, was
a name given to their country by the
Jagas, that its true name was Framazugda,
and that the people were called
Framazugs. That it was situated at a
great distance in the interior, in a direction
west by north, and that it was surrounded
by negro and savage nations,
through whom a trade was carried on
with people at the north-west and east,
none of whom, however, were ever seen
at Framazugda, as the trade had to pass
through a number of hands. Enphadde
represented the country to be of considerable
extent, consisting mostly of a
lofty plateau or elevated plain, and exceedingly
populous, containing numerous
large cities, surrounded by high walls,
and filled with houses of stone. Several
large streams and lakes watered the soil,
which, according to his account, was closely
cultivated, and produced in abundance the
greatest variety of trees, fruits, flowers,
and grain. Over this country ruled Selha
Shouns&eacute;, the father of Enphadde and Kaloolah,
as king. It was in going from the
capital to one of the royal gardens that
their escort was attacked by a party of
blacks from the lowlands, the attendants
killed or dispersed, and the young prince
and princess carried off."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirty dollars could hardly be
deemed a heavy price for the son and
daughter of the great Shouns&eacute;, and
Jonathan was well pleased with his
bargain, although it was not yet clear
how he should realise a profit; but
meanwhile it was something to be the
proprietor of their royal highnesses of
Framazugda; something too to gaze
into Kaloolah's bright black eyes, and
listen to her dulcet tones, as she
warbled one of her country's ditties
about the Fultul, a sweet-scented
lily flourishing beside the rivulets of
her native mountains. The verses,
by the bye, are not to be commended
in Mr Romer's version; they perhaps
sounded better in the original Framazug,
and when issuing from the sweet
lips of Kaloolah.</p>

<p>Instead of a week, the Bonito was
month absent, having been caught
in a calm. Captain Pedro Garbez
promised the Virgin Mary the value
of a young negro in wax-lights for a
capful of wind, but in vain; and he
was fain to tear the hair from his
head with impatience. Meanwhile
Jonathan had caught a fever in the
swamps of Congo, and Kaloolah had
made his chicken-broth, and tended
him tenderly, and restored him to
health, although he was still so
altered in appearance that Garbez
knew him not when he mounted the
side of the slaver. All speed was
now made to buy and ship a cargo.
The account of the latter process is
interesting, and, we have no doubt,
perfectly authentic; for although the
author of <i>Kaloolah</i> has chosen to interlard,
and perhaps deteriorate his
book by strange stories of imaginary
countries, animals, flowers, &amp;c., it is
not difficult to distinguish between
his fact and his fiction, and to recognise
the internal evidence of veracity
and personal observation. A short
extract may here with propriety be
made, for the benefit of anti-slavery
philanthropists.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first slaves that came on board
were taken below the berth-deck, and
arranged upon a temporary slave-deck
placed over the water-casks, and at a
distance of not more than three feet and
a half from the deck overhead....
The slaves were arranged in four ranks.
When lying down, the heads of the two
outer ranks touched the sides of the ship,
their feet pointing inboard or athwart
the vessel. They, of course, occupied a
space fore and aft the ship, of about six
feet on either side, or twelve feet of the
whole breadth. At the feet of the outside
rank came the heads of the inner
row. They took up a space of six feet
more on either side, or together twelve
feet. There was still left a space running
up and down the centre of the deck, two
or three feet in breadth; along this were
stretched single slaves, between the feet of
the two inner rows, so that, when all were
lying down, almost every square foot of
the deck was covered with a mass of human
flesh. Not the slightest space was
allowed between the individuals of the
ranks, but the whole were packed as
closely as they could be, each slave having
just room enough to stretch himself
out flat upon his back, and no more. In
this way about two hundred and fifty were
crowded upon the slave-deck, and as
many more upon the berth-deck. Horrible
as this may seem, it was nothing
compared to the 'packing' generally
practised by slavers. Captain Garbez
boasted that he had tried both systems,
tight packing and loose packing, thoroughly,
and found the latter the best.</p>

<p>"'If you call this loose packing,' I
replied, 'have the goodness to explain
what you mean by tight packing?'</p>

<p>"'Why, tight packing consists in making
a row sit with their legs stretched
apart, and then another row is placed
between their legs, and so on, until the
whole deck is filled. In the one case
each slave has as much room as he can
cover lying; in the other only as much
room as he can occupy sitting. With
tight packing this craft ought to stow
fifteen hundred.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bonito was not above three
hundred tons. Such are the blessings
for which the negroes are indebted to
the tender-mercied emancipators who
have ruined our West Indian colonies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'When it comes to closing the
hatches,' (in the event of a gale) said
Captain Pedro, 'it is all up with the
voyage. You can hardly save enough to
pay expenses. They die like leeches in
a thunderstorm. I was once in a little
schooner with three hundred on board,
and we were compelled to lie-to for three
days. It was the worst sea I ever saw,
and came near swamping us several times.
We lost two hundred and fifty slaves in
that gale. We couldn't get at the dead
ones to throw them overboard very
handily, and so those that didn't die from
want of air were killed by the rolling
and tumbling about of the corpses. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the living ones some had their limbs
broken, and every one had the flesh of
his leg worn to the bone, by the shackle
irons.'</p>

<p>"'Good God! and you still pursue the
horrible trade?'</p>

<p>"'Certainly; why not? Despite of
accidents the trade is profitable, and, for
the cruelty of it, no one is to blame
except the English. Were it not for
them, large and roomy vessels would be
employed, and it would be an object to
bring the slaves over with every comfort,
and in as good condition as possible.
Now, every consideration must be sacrificed
to the one great object&mdash;escape from
capture by the British cruisers.'</p>

<p>"I had no wish to reply to the captain's
argument. One might as well reply
to a defence of blasphemy or murder.
Giddy, faint, and sick, I turned with
loathing from the fiends in human guise,
and sought the more genial companionship
of the inmates of my state-room."</p></blockquote>

<p>These were Kaloolah and Enphadde.
To conceal the beauty of the
former, perilous amidst the lawless
crew of the slaver, Jonathan had
marked her face with caustic, producing
black spots which had the
appearance of disease. This temporary
disfigurement secured her from
licentious outrage, but not from harsh
treatment. Monte, second captain of
the Bonito, was an ex-pirate, whose
vessel had been destroyed by Yankee
cruisers. To spite Romer, whom he
detested as an American, he threatened
to send Kaloolah and her brother
amongst the slaves, and took every
opportunity of abusing them. Chapter
xxi. passes wholly on board
the slaver, and is excellent of its
kind. The Bonito is chased by a
man-of-war, but escapes. At daybreak,
whilst lying in his berth,
Romer hears a bustle on deck, followed
by shrill cries and plunges in
the water. The following is good:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I jumped from my berth and stepped
out upon deck. A dense fog brooded
upon the surface of the ocean, and closely
enveloped the ship&mdash;standing up on
either side, like huge perpendicular walls
of granite, and leaving a comparatively
clear space&mdash;the area of the deck and
the height of the main-topmast crosstrees.
Inboard, the sight ranged nearly free
fore-and-aft the ship, but seaward no
eye could penetrate, more than a yard or
two, the solid-looking barrier of vapour.
A man standing on the taffrail might have
seen the catheads the whole length of the
deck, whilst at the same time, behind him,
the end of the spanker boom, projecting
over the water, was lost in the mist. I
looked up at the perpendicular walls and
the lofty arch overhead with feelings of
awe, and, I may add, fear. Cursed, indeed,
must be our craft, when the genius of
the mist so carefully avoided the pollution
of actual contact. His rolling legions
were close around us, but vapoury horse
and misty foot shrank back affrighted
from the horrors of our blood-stained
decks."</p></blockquote>

<p>The phenomenon was doubtless
attributable to the hot air generated
in the crowded 'tween-decks. The
cries and plashings that had startled
Jonathan were soon explained. Virulent
ophthalmia raged on board, and
Monte was drowning the blind, whose
value of course departed with their
eyesight. A blind slave was "an
encumbrance, an unsaleable article, a
useless expense. Pitch him overboard!
Twenty-five to-day, and a
dozen more to-morrow!" But retribution
was at hand, threatened, at
least, by a British brig-of-war, which
appeared when the fog cleared, at
about a mile and a half to windward.
During the chase, Monte, casually
jostled by Kaloolah, struck her to the
deck, and a furious scuffle ensued
between him and Jonathan, who at
last, seeing some of the crew approaching,
knife in hand, leaped overboard,
dragging his antagonist with
him, and followed by Enphadde and
Kaloolah. After a deep dive, during
which Monte's tenacious grasp
was at last relaxed, the intrepid
Jonathan regained the surface, where
he and his friends and enemy easily
supported themselves till picked up by
the brig. The swift slaver escaped.
Monte was put in irons, Romer and
his Framazugdan friends were made
much of by Captain Halsey and the
officers of her Majesty's brig Flyaway,
and landed in the picturesque but pestilent
shores of Sierra Leone. Then
Kaloolah and her brother propose to
seek their way homewards, and
Jonathan takes ship for Liverpool.
Previously to his departure, there are
some love passages between the Yankee
and the Princess of Framazugda.
These are not particularly successful.
Sentiment is not Dr Mayo's <i>forte</i>: he
is much happier in scenes of bustle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and adventure&mdash;when urging his
weary dromedary across boundless
tracts of sand, or waging deadly combat
with the fierce inmates of African
jungles. His book will delight Mr
Van Amburgh. There is a duel between
a lion and a boa that we make
no doubt of seeing dramatised at
Astley's, as soon as a serpent can be
tamed sufficiently for the performance.
That Dr Mayo's lions are of
the very first magnitude, the following
description shows:&mdash;"His body
was hardly less in size than that of a
dray-horse; his paw as large as the
foot of an elephant; while his head!&mdash;what
can be said of such a head?
Concentrate the fury, the power, the
capacity, and the disposition for evil of
a dozen thunderstorms into a round
globe about two feet in diameter, and
one would then be able to get an idea
of the terrible expression of that head
and face, enveloped and set off as it
was by the dark framework of bristling
mane!" This pleasing quadruped,
disturbed in its forest solitude
by the advent of Jonathan and the
fair Kaloolah, who have wandered,
lover-like, to some distance from their
bivouac, at once prepares to breakfast
upon them. Jonathan had imprudently
laid down his gun to pluck
wild honeysuckles for his mistress,
when the lion, stepping in, cuts him
off from his weapon. Suddenly "the
light figure of Kaloolah rushed past
me: 'Fly, fly, Jon'than!' she wildly
exclaimed, as she dashed forward
directly towards the lion. Quick as
thought, I divined her purpose, and
sprang after her, grasping her dress,
and pulling her forcibly back, almost
from within those formidable jaws.
The astonished animal gave several
jumps sideways and backwards, and
stopped, crouching to the ground, and
growling and lashing his sides with
renewed fury. It was clearly taken
aback by our unexpected charge upon
him, but yet was not to be frightened
into abandoning his prey. His mouth
was made up for us, and there could
be no doubt, if his motions <i>were</i> a
little slow, that he considered us as
good as gorged." Pulling back Kaloolah,
and drawing his knife, Romer
awaits, with desperate determination,
the monster's terrible onslaught, when
an unexpected ally arrives to the
rescue. "It seemed as if one of the
gigantic creepers I have mentioned
had suddenly quitted the canopy
above, and, endowed with life and a
huge pair of widely distended jaws,
had darted with the rapidity of lightning
upon the crouching beast. There
was a tremendous shaking of the treetops,
and a confused wrestling and
jumping and whirling over and about,
amid a cloud of upturned roots and
earth and leaves, accompanied with
the most terrific roars and groans.
As I looked again, vision grew more
distinct. An immense body, gleaming
with purple, green, and gold, appeared
convoluted around the majestic
branches overhead, and, stretching
down, was turned two or three times
around the struggling lion, whose head
and neck were almost concealed from
sight within the cavity of a pair of jaws
still more capacious than his own."
A full-grown boa, whose length is
estimated by Mr Romer at about a hundred
feet, (much less than many he subsequently
saw, but still "a very respectable-sized
snake,") had dropped
a few fathoms of coil from the gigantic
tree around which he was twined, and
enveloped the lion, who soon was
crushed to death in the scaly embrace.
Jonathan makes no doubt that the
serpent was about to swallow his victim
whole, according to the custom of
his kind; and it is certainly to be regretted
that the entreaties of Kaloolah,
combined with the "strong sickly
odour" diffused by the boa, prevented
his remaining to witness a process of
deglutition which, considering the dimensions
of the morsel to be swallowed,
could not have been otherwise
than curious.</p>

<p>Wrecked a second time, Romer
again reaches the coast of Africa, in
company with an old sailor named
Jack Thompson. They fall into the
hands of the Bedouins, and suffer
much ill treatment, an account of
which, and of various adventures and
escapes, occupy many chapters, and
would have borne a little curtailment.
Romer is wandering about with a
tribe, upon whom he has passed himself
off as an Arab from a distant
region, when he is compelled to join
in an attack on a caravan. Kaloolah
is amongst the prisoners. She has
been captured by a party of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>slave-hunters,
and is on her way to Morocco,
where her master hopes her
beauty will fetch a good price from
the Emperor Muley Abderrahman.
In the partition of the spoil, she falls
to the share of an old Arab, who is
ill satisfied with the acquisition.
"He was extremely chagrined at the
turn of fortune which threatened to
throw into the wrangling elements of
his domestic felicity a feminine superfluity&mdash;or,
as he expressed it, 'another
tongue in his tent.'</p>

<p>"'Bismillah!' he exclaimed; 'God
is great, but this is a small thing!
She is not a man; she is not a black&mdash;she
cannot work; but won't she eat
and talk! They all eat and talk. I
take a club sometimes, and knock
them down; beat them; break their
bones; but they still eat and talk!
God's will be done! but it is too much
to put such a thing upon me for my
share! She is good for nothing: I
cannot sell her.'"</p>

<p>The grumbling old Bedouin did sell
her, however, to Jonathan, for three
or four cotton shirts. Flight now
becomes necessary, for Hassan, son
of the chief of the tribe, seeks Jonathan's
life, and Mrs Ali, the chief's
wife, persecutes him with her misplaced
affection, and is spiteful to
Kaloolah, whom she looks upon as the
chief obstacle to its requital. Upon
this head our Yankee is rather good:
"Respect for the sex," he says, "and
a sentiment of gentlemanly delicacy,
which the reader will appreciate, prevents
me from dwelling upon the
story at length. It was wrong, undoubtedly,
in Seffora to love any
other than her old, rugose-faced,
white-bearded husband; but it is not
for me to blame her. One thing,
however, in her conduct can hardly be
excused. True, I might have treated
her affection with more tenderness; I
might have nursed the gentle flowers
of passion, instead of turning away
from their fragrance; I might have responded
to that 'yearning of the soul
for sympathy'&mdash;have relieved, with
the food of love, 'the mighty hunger
of the heart;' but all this, and more
that I might have done, but did not
do, gave her no right to throw stones
at Kaloolah." To avoid the pelting
and other disagreeables, the lovers
take themselves off in the night-time,
mounted on <i>heiries</i>&mdash;camels of a peculiar
breed and excellence, famed in
the desert for endurance and speed.
On their road they pick up, in a
Moorish village, an Irish renegade;
at some salt-works, they find Jack
Thompson working as a slave; and
soon afterwards their party is increased
to five persons, by the addition
of Hassan, a runaway negro. With
this motley tail, Mr Romer pushes on
in the direction of Framazugda. Here
the editor very judiciously epitomises
six long chapters in as many pages;
and, immediately after this compressed
portion, there begins what may be
strictly termed the fabulous, or almost
the supernatural part of the book.
Previously to this there have been not
a few rather startling incidents, but
now the author throws the rein on the
neck of his imagination, and scours
away into the realms of the extravagant;
still striving, however, by circumstantial
detail, to give an appearance
of probability to his astounding
and ingenious inventions. Some of
the descriptions of scenery and savage
life in the wilderness are vivid and
striking, and show power which might
be better applied. Of the fabulous
animals, the following account of an
amiable reptile, peculiar to central
Africa, will serve as a sufficient specimen
of Yankee natural history:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is an amphibious polypus. If the
reader will conceive a large cart-wheel,
the <i>hub</i> will represent the body of the
animal, and the spokes the long arms,
about the size and shape of a full-grown
kangaroo's tail, and twenty in number,
that project from it. When the animal
moves upon land, it stiffens these radii,
and rolls over upon the points like a
wheel without a felloe. These arms have
also <i>the capability of a lateral prehensile
contraction in curves, perpendicular to its
plane of revolution</i>, and enable the animal
to grasp its prey, and draw it into its
voracious mouth. It attacks the largest
animals, and even man itself; but, if dangerous
upon land, it is still more formidable
in the water, where it has been known
to attack and kill an alligator. This
horrible monster is known by the name
of the Sempersough or 'snake-star,' and is
more dreaded than any other animal of
Framazugda, inasmuch as the natives
have no way of destroying it, except by
catching it when young, in cane traps
sunk in the water, and baited with hippopotamus
cubs(!) Fortunately it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
very prolific; and its increase is further
prevented by the furious contests that
these animals have among themselves.
Sometimes twenty or thirty will grasp
each other with their long arms, and
twist themselves up into a hard and intricate
knot. In this situation they remain,
hugging and gnawing each other to
death; and never relaxing their grasp
until their arms are so firmly intertwined
that, when life is extinct, and the huge
mass floats, they cannot be separated.
The natives now draw the ball ashore,
cut it up with axes, and make it into a
compost for their land." (!!)</p></blockquote>

<p>Is Dr Mayo addicted to heavy suppers?
We can just fancy an unfortunate
individual, after a midnight
meal on a shield of brawn and a Brobdingnagian
crab, which he has omitted
to qualify by a subsequent series of
stiff tumblers, sinking into an uneasy
slumber, and being rolled over by such
an incubus as this vivacious waggon-wheel.
Doubtless there is a possibility
of a man dieting himself into this
style of writing, whereof a short specimen
may excite a smile, but whose
frequent recurrence is necessarily
wearisome, and which obviously escapes
criticism. But the author of
<i>Kaloolah</i> is not contented with brute
monstrosities. He chronicles reports
that reach his hero's ears, of nations
of human monsters, with teeth filed
to a sharp point (no uncommon practice
amongst certain negro tribes,)
with tusks projecting like those of a
wild boar, and with pendant lips that
continually drop blood. All this is
childish enough; but Jack Thompson,
who is a dry dog, caps these astounding
fictions with a cannibal yarn from
the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I've been among the New Zealanders,'
quoth Jack, 'and there they use
each other for fresh grub, as regular as
boiled duff in a man-of-war's mess. They
used to eat their fathers and mothers,
when they got too old to take care of
themselves; but now they've got to be
more civilised, and so they only eat
rickety children, and slaves, and enemies
taken in battle.'</p>

<p>"'A decided instance of the progress
of improvement, and march of mind,'
said I.</p>

<p>"'Well, I believe that is what the
missionaries call it,' replied Jack; 'but
it's a bad thing for the old folks. They
don't take to the new fashion&mdash;they are
in favour of the good old custom. I never
see'd the thing myself; but Bill Brown,
a messmate of mine once, told me that,
when he was at the Bay of Islands, he
see'd a great many poor old souls going
about with tears in their eyes, trying to
get somebody to eat them. One of them
came off to the ship, and told them that
he couldn't find rest in the stomachs of
any of his kindred, and wanted to know
if the crew wouldn't take him in. The
skipper told him he was on monstrous
short allowance, but he couldn't accommodate
him. The poor old fellow, Bill
said, looked as though his heart would
break. There were plenty of sharks
round the ship, and the skipper advised
him to jump overboard; but he couldn't
bear the idea of being eaten raw.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The great audacity of Dr Mayo's
fictions preclude surprise at the boldness
of his tropes and similes. The
tails of his lions lash the ground
"with a sound like the falling of
clods upon a coffin;" their roar is like
the boom of a thirty-two pounder,
shaking the trees, and rattling the
boulders in the bed of the river. Of
course, allowance must be made for
the vein of humorous rhodomontade
peculiar to certain American writers,
and into which Dr Mayo sometimes
unconsciously glides, and, at others, voluntarily
indulges. His description of
the conjuring tricks of the Framazugdan
jugglers comes under the latter
head.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some of them were truly wonderful,
as, for instance, turning a man into a tree
bearing fruit, and with monkeys skipping
about in the branches; and another case,
where the chief juggler apparently swallowed
five men, ten boys, and a jackass,
threw them all up again, turned himself
inside out, blew himself up like a balloon,
and, exploding with a loud report, disappeared
in a puff of luminous vapour. I
could not but admire the skill with which
the tricks were performed, although I was
too much of a Yankee to be much astonished
at anything in the <i>Hey, Presto!</i>
line."</p></blockquote>

<p>A countryman of Mr Jefferson Davis
is not expected to feel surprise at
anything in the way of sleight of
hand, or "double shuffle;" and there
was probably nothing more startling
to the senses in the evaporation of
King Shouns&eacute;'s conjuror, than in the
natural self-extinction of the Mississippian
debt. It is only a pity that
Jonathan Romer did not carry his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
smart fellow-citizen to the country of
the <i>Pholdefoos</i>, a class of enthusiasts
who devote their lives to a search for
the germs of moral, religious, and
political truth. Mr Davis would have
felt rather out of his element at first,
but could not have failed ultimately
to have benefited by his sojourn
amongst these singular savages.</p>

<p>On coming in sight of her father's
capital, Kaloolah is overcome with
emotion, and sinks weeping into her
brother's arms. "I felt," says Jonathan,
"that this was a situation in
which even the most sympathising
lover would be <i>de trop</i>. There were
thronging associations which I could
not share, vibrating memories to which
my voice was not attuned, bonds of
affection which all-powerful love might
transcend, and even disrupt, but
whose precise nature it could not assume.
There are some lovers who
are jealous of such things&mdash;fellows
who like to wholly monopolise a
woman, and who are constantly on
the watch, seizing and appropriating
her every look, thought, and feeling,
with somewhat of the same notion of
an exclusive right, as that with which
they pocket a tooth-pick. I am not
of that turn. The female heart is as
curiously and as variously stocked as
a country dry-goods store. A man
may be perhaps allowed to select out,
for his own exclusive use, some of the
heavier articles, such as sheetings,
shirtings, flannels, trace-chains, hobby-horses,
and goose-yokes; but that
is no reason why the neighbours should
be at once cut off from their accustomed
supply of small-wares."</p>

<p>We venture to calculate that it
takes a full-blooded Yankee to write
in this strain, which, reminds us, remotely,
it is true, of some of Mr
Samuel Slick's eccentric fancies. Dr
Mayo has considerable versatility of
pen; he dashes at everything, from
the ultra-grotesque to the hyper-sentimental,
from the wildest fable to the
most substantial matter-of-fact; and
if not particularly successful in some
styles, in others he really makes what
schoolboys call "a very good offer."
But the taste of the day is by no
means for extravaganza travels, after
the fashion of Gulliver, but without
the brilliant and searching satire that
lurks in Lilliput and Laputa. Mr
Herman Melville might have known
that much; although we have heard
say that certain keen critics have
caught glimpses in his <i>Mardi</i> of a
hidden meaning&mdash;one, however, which
the most penetrating have hitherto
been unable to unravel. We advise
Dr Mayo to start afresh, with a better
scheme. Instead of torturing his inventive
faculties to produce rotatory
dragons, wingless birds, (propelled
through the air by valves in their
heads,) and countries where courtiers,
like Auriol in the ring at Franconi's,
do public homage by standing on their
hands; let him seek his inspiration in
real life, as it exists in the wilder regions
of the vast continent of which
he is a native. A man who has
strayed so far, and seen so much, can
hardly be at a loss. The slaver's
surgeon, the inmate of the Bedouin's
tent, the bold explorer of the deadly
swamps of Congo, had surely rambled
nearer home before a restless fancy
lured him to such distant and dangerous
latitudes. Or are we too bold in
assuming that the wilds and forests of
Western America have echoed to the
crack of his rifle, and that the West
Indian seas have borne the furrow of
his vessel's prow? It is in such scenes
we would gladly find him, when next
he risks himself in print: beneath the
shade of the live oak or on the rolling
prairie, or where the black flag, with
the skeleton emblem, floats from the
masthead. He has worked out his
crotchet of an imaginary white nation
in the heart of Africa, carrying it
through with laborious minuteness,
and with results hardly equal to the
pains bestowed: let him now turn
from the ideal to the real, and may
our next meeting be on the Spanish
main under rover's bunting, or west
of the clearings, where the bison
roams and the Redskin prowls, and the
stragglers from civilisation have but
begun to show themselves.</p>

<h3>A "SHORT" YARN.&mdash;PART III.</h3>


<p>The evening after that in which
the commander of the Gloucester
Indiaman introduced his adventures,
nearly the same party met on the poop
to hear them continued.</p>

<p>"Well then," began Captain Collins,
leaning back against a stanchion
of the quarter-rail, with folded arms,
legs crossed, and his eyes fixed on the
weather-leech of the mizen-topsail to
collect his thoughts;&mdash;"well then,
try to fancy the Seringapatam in
chase of the Gloucester; and if I <i>do</i>
use a few extra sea-terms, I consider
the ladies good enough sailors for them
already. At any rate, just throw a
glance aloft now and then, and our
good old lady will explain herself; to
her own sex, she's as good as a dictionary
without words!"</p>

<p>The second day out we had the wind
more from seaward, which broke up
the haze into bales of cloud, and
away they went rolling in for the Bay
of Biscay; with a longer wave and
darker water, and the big old Indiaman
surged over it as easily as might
be, the blue breeze gushing right into
her main-tack through the heave of
the following seas, and the tail of
the trade-wind flying high above
her trucks in shreds and patches.
Things got more ship-shape on deck;
anchor-flukes brought inboard on
the head-rail, and cables stowed
away&mdash;the very best sign you can
have of being clear of the land.
The first officer, as they called him,
was a good-looking fellow, that thought
no small-beer of himself, with his
glossy blue jacket and Company's buttons,
white trowsers, and a gold thread
round his cap: he had it stuck askew
to show how his hair was brushed,
and changed his boots every time he
came on deck. Still he looked like a
sailor, if but for the East India brown
on his face, and there was no mistake
about his knowing how to set a sail,
trim yards, or put the ship about;
so that the stiff old skipper left a great
deal to him, besides trusting in him
for a first-rate navigator that had
learned headwork at a naval school.
The crew were to be seen all mustering
before tea-time in the dog-watch,
with their feet just seen under the
foot mat of the fore-course, like actors
behind a playhouse curtain: men that
I warrant you had seen every country
under heaven amongst them, as private
as possible, and ready to enjoy
their pots of tea upon the forecastle,
as well as their talk.</p>

<p>The old judge evidently fought shy of
company, and perhaps meant to have
his own mess-table under the poop
as long as the voyage lasted: scarcely
any of the ladies had apparently got
their sea-qualms over yet, and, for
all I knew, <i>she</i> might not be on board
at all; or, if she were, her father
seemed quite Turk enough to keep
her boxed up with jalousie-blinds,
Calcutta fashion, and give her a
walk in the middle watch, with the
poop tabooed till morning! The
jolly, red-faced indigo-planter was
the only one that tried to get up anything
like spirit at the table; indeed,
he would have scraped acquaintance
with me if I had been in a mood for
it: all I did was to say 'Yes' and
'No,' and to take wine with him.
"Poor fellow!" said he, turning to
three or four of the cadets, that stuck
by him like pilot-fish to an old shark,
"he's thinking of his mother at home,
I daresay." The fools thought this
was meant as a joke, and began to
laugh. "Why, you unfledged griffins
you," said the planter, "what
d'ye see to nicker at, like so many
jackals in a trap? D'ye suppose one
thinks the less of a man for having a
heart to be sick in, as well as a stomach&mdash;eh?"
"Oh, don't speak of it,
Mr Rollock!" said one. "Come,
come, old boy!" said another, with a
white mustache on his lip, "'twon't
do for you to go the sentimental, you
know!" "Capsize my main-spanker,
'tis too funny, though!" put in a fellow
who wore a glazed hat on deck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>and put down all the ropes with numbers
on paper, as soon as he had done
being sick. The planter leant back
in his chair, looked at them coolly,
and burst out a-laughing. "Catch me
ever 'going home' again!" said he.
"Of all the absurd occasions for impudence
with the egg-shell on its head
coming out, hang me if these fifteen
thousand miles of infernal sea-water
ain't the worst! India for ever!&mdash;that's
the place to <i>try</i> a man! He's
either sobered or gets room to work
there; and just wait, my fine fellows,
till I see <i>you</i> on the Custom-house
<i>Bunda</i> at Bombay, or setting off up
country&mdash;you're all of you the very
food for <i>sircars</i> and <i>coolies</i>! That
quiet lad there, now, soft as he looks,&mdash;I
can tell by his eye he won't be
long a griff&mdash;He'll do something! I
tell you what, as soon as he's tasted
a mango-fish, he'll <i>understand</i> the
country! Why, sir!" said he again,
smacking his lips, "'tis worth the
voyage of itself&mdash;you begin a new
existence, so to speak! I'll be bound
all this lot o' water don't contain one
single mango-fish! Remember, boys,
I promised you all a regular blow-out
of mango-fish, and <i>florican</i> with bread sauce,
whenever you can get across to
Chuckbully Factory!" "Blow good
breeze, then; blow away the main
jib!" said the nautical young gentleman;
"I'll join you, old fellow!"
"Not the best way to bring it about,
though!" said the indigo-planter,
good-naturedly, not knowing but there
<i>was</i> such a sail on the ship.</p>

<p>The yellow setting sun was striking
over the starboard quarter-boat, and
the Bay of Biscay lay broad down
to leeward for a view&mdash;a couple of
large craft, with all studding-sails
set before the wind, making for land,
far enough off to bring their canvass
in a piece, and begin to look
blue with the air&mdash;one like a milkwoman
with pitchers and a hoop;
the other like a girl carrying a big
bucketful of water, and leaning the
opposite way to steady herself. There
was one far to north-east, too, no more
than a white speck in the gray sky;
and the land-cloud went up over it
into so many sea-lions' heads, all looking
out of their manes. The children
clapped their hands and laughed; and
the ladies talked about the vessels,
and thought they saw land&mdash;Spain or
the Pyrenees, perhaps. However, it
wasn't long before my American friend
Snout caught sight of me in the midst of
his meditations, as he turned bolt round
on his toes to hurry aft again.
"The fact is, mister," said he,
"<i>I'm</i> riled a little at <i>the</i> 'tarnation
pride of you Britishers. There now,"
said he, pointing at the blaze of the
sun to westward, with his chin,
"there's <i>a</i> consolation! I calculate
the sun's just over Noo-York, which
I expect to give you old country folks
considerable pain!"</p>

<p>"No doubt!" said I, with a sigh,
"one can't help thinking of a banker
run off with ever so much English
gold!" "You're a sensible chap,
you are. It's <i>a</i> right-down asylum
<i>for</i> oppressed Eur<i>o</i>pains, that can't
be denied." "And Africans too,"
I put in. "Indy, now," said he,
"I reckon there's a sight of
dollars made in that country&mdash;you
don't s'pose I'm goin' out there for
nothing? We'll just take it out o'
your hands yet, mister. I don't ought
to let you into the scheme till I know
you better, you see; but I expect to
want a sort o' company got up before
we land. There's one of your nabobs,
now, came into the ship at Possmouth
with a whole tail of niggers-dressed-up
----." "And a lady with him, I
think?" said I, as coolly as I could.&mdash;"I'll
somehow open on that chap
about British tyranny, I guess, after
gettin' a little knowledge out of
him. We'd just <i>rise</i> the niggurs,
if they had <i>not</i> such a right-down
cur'ous <i>my</i>-thullogy&mdash;but I tell you
now, mister, that's one of the very
p'ints I expect to meet. Miss'naries
won't do it so slick off in two thousand
years, I kinder think, as this
indentical specoolation will in <i>ten</i>,&mdash;besides
payin' like Peruvain mines,
which the miss'nary line don't. I'm
a regoolar Down-easter, ye see&mdash;kinder
piercin' into a subject, like our
nation in gin'ral&mdash;and the whull
schim hangs together a little, I calculate,
mister?" "So I should
think, Mr Snout, indeed," I said.
Here the American gave another
chuckle, and turned to again on his
walk, double quick, till you'd have
thought the whole length of the poop
shook: when who should I see with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
tail of my eye, but my friend the <i>Kitmagar</i>
salaaming to Mr Snout, by the
break of the quarterdeck. The
Yankee seemed rather taken aback at
first, and didn't know what to make
of him. "S'laam, sah'b," said the
dark servant, with an impudent look,
and loud enough for me to hear, as I
stepped from aft,&mdash;"Judge sahib
i-send genteeman salaam&mdash;say too
much hivvy boot he got&mdash;all same as
<i>Illimphant</i>! S'pose master not so
much loud walk, <i>this</i> side?" "<i>Well!</i>"
broke out the American, looking at
the Bengalee's flat turban and mustache,
as if he were too great a curiosity
to be angry with, then, turning
on his heel to proceed with his walk,
"Now, mister," said he to me, "that's
what I call an incalculable imp<i>u</i>dent
black&mdash;but he's the first I ever saw
with hair on his lip, it's a fact!"
"Master not <i>mind</i>?" said the Kitmagar,
raising his key next time Mr
Snout wheeled round. "Judge sahib
burra burra buhadoorkea!&mdash;ver' great
man!" "D&mdash;&mdash; niggur!" said Mr
Snout, tramping away aft; "there's
your British regoolations, I say, young
man! niggurs b&agrave;&agrave;ing on the quarterdeck,
and free-born citizens put off
it!" "<i>Bhote khoob</i>, mistree!"
squeaked out the native again; "burra
judge sahib not i-sleep apter he dine?&mdash;ver<i>i</i>
well&mdash;I tell the sahib, passiger
mistree moor stamp-i-stamp all the
moor I can say!" So off he went to
report in the poop-cabin. A little
after, up shot a head wrapped in a
yellow bandanna, just on the level of
the poop-deck, looking through the
breast-rail; and the next thing I saw
was the great East Indian himself,
with a broad-flapped Manilla hat over
this top-gear, and a red-flowered
dressing-gown, standing beside the
binnacle with Captain Williamson.
"What the deuce, Captain Williamson!"
said the judge, with an angry
glance up to the poop, "cannot I
close my eyelids after dinner for one
instant&mdash;in my own private apartments,
sir&mdash;for this hideous noise!
Who the deuce <i>is</i> that person there&mdash;eh,
eh?" "He's an American
gentleman, I believe, Sir Charles,"
replied the captain. "<i>Believe</i>, sir!"
said the judge, "you ought to <i>know</i>
every individual, I think, Captain
Williamson, whom you admitted into
this vessel! I expressly stipulated
for quiet, sir&mdash;I understood that no
suspicious or exceptionable persons
should travel in the same conveyance
with <i>my</i> suwarry. I'd have taken
the whole ship, sir!" "I've no
more to do than tell him the regulations
aboard, Sir Charles," said the
captain, "and the annoyance will
cease." "<i>Tell</i> him, indeed!" said
the judge, a little more good-humouredly,
"why, captain, the man looks
like a sea-pirate! You should have
taken only such raw griffins as that
young lad on the other side. Ho,
kitmagar!" "Maharaj?" said the
footman, bowing down to the deck.
"<i>Slippers lao!</i>" "Jee, khodabund,"
answered the native, and immediately
after he reappeared from the round-house
door, with a pair of turned-up
yellow slippers. "Take them up
with my salaam to that gentleman
there," said Sir Charles, in Hindostance,
"and ask him to use them."
"Hullo!," sung out Mr Snout, on
being hove-to by the kitmagar, with
one hand on his breast and the other
holding the slippers, "this won't do!
You'd better not <i>rile</i> me again, you
cussed niggur you&mdash;out o' my way!"
There they went at it along the poop
together, Mr Snout striding right forward
with his long legs, and the kitmagar
hopping backward out of his
way, as he tried to make himself understood;
till, all at once, the poor
fellow lost his balance at the ladder-head,
and over he went with a smash
fit to have broken his neck, if the
captain's broad back hadn't fortunately
been there to receive it. The
rage of Sir Charles at this was quite
beyond joking; nothing else would
satisfy him but the unlucky Yankee's
being shoved off the poop by main
force, and taken below&mdash;the one
stamping and roaring like an old
buffalo, and the other testifying
against all "aristocratycal <i>ty</i>ranny."</p>

<p>At eight bells, again, I found it a
fine breezy night, the two upper
mates walking the weather quarterdeck
in blue-water style, six steps
and a look to windward, then a
wheel round, and, now and then, a
glance into the binnacle. I went aft
and leant over the Seringapatam's
lee quarter, looking at the white backwash
running aft from her bows, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
green sparks, into the smooth alongside,
and the surge coming round her
counter to meet it. Everything was
set aloft that could draw, even to a
starboard main-topmast-stunsail; the
high Indiaman being lighter than if
homeward-bound, and the breeze
strong abeam, she had a good heel-over
to port: but she went easily
through the water, and it was only at
the other side you heard it rattling
both ways along the bends. The
shadow of her went far to leeward,
except where a gleam came on the top
of a wave or two between the sails
and under their foot. Just below the
sheer of the hull aft it was as dark as
night, though now and then the light
from a port struck on it and went in
again; but every time she sank, the
bight of her wake from astern
swelled up away round the counter,
with its black side as smooth as a
looking-glass. I kept peering into it,
and expecting to see my own face,
while all the time I was very naturally
thinking of one quite different, and
felt uneasy till I should actually see
her. "Confound it!" I thought,
"were it only a house, one might walk
round and round it till he found out
the window!" I fancied her bewitching
face through the garden door, as
clearly as if I saw it in the dark head
of the swell; but I'd have given
more only to hear that imp of a
cockatoo scream once&mdash;whereas there
was nothing but the water working up
into the rudder-case; the pintles
creaking, and the tiller-ropes cheeping
as they traversed; and the long
welter of the sea when the ship eased
down, with the surgeon and his friends
walking about and laughing up to
windward. From that, again, I ran
on putting things together, till, in
fact, Jacobs's notion of a shipwreck
seemed by far the best. No doubt
Jacobs and Westwood, with a few
others, would be saved, while I didn't
even object much to the old nabob
himself, for respectability's sake,
and to spare crape. But, by Jove,
wouldn't one bring him to his bearings
soon enough there! Every sailor
gets hold of this notion some night-watch
or other, leaning over the side,
with pretty creatures aboard he can
scarce speak to otherwise; and I was
coiling it down so fast myself, at the
moment, that I had just begun to
pitch into the nabob about our all
being Adam's sons and daughters,
under a knot of green palm-trees, at
the door of a wooden house, half
thatched with leaves, when I was
brought up with a round turn by seeing
a light shining through the hazy
bull's-eye in the deck where I stood.
No doubt the sweet girl I had been
thinking of was actually there, and
going to bed! I stretched over the
quarter, but the heavy mouldings
were in the way of seeing more than
the green bars of the after window&mdash;all
turned edgeways to the water,
where the gallery hung out like a
corner turret from the ship's side.
Now and then, however, when she
careened a little more than ordinary,
and the smooth lee swell went heaping
up opposite, I could notice the light
through the venetians from the state-room
come out upon the dark water
in broad bright lines, like the grate
across a fire, then disappearing in a
ripple, till it was gone again, or somebody's
shadow moved inside. It
was the only lighted window in the
gallery, and I looked every time
it came as if I could see in; when at
last, you may fancy my satisfaction,
as, all of a sudden, one long slow heave-over
of the ship showed me the whole
bright opening of the port, squared
out of her shadow, where it shone
upon the glassy round of the swell.
'Twas as plain as from a mirror in a
closet,&mdash;the lighted gallery window
with its frame swung in, a bit of the
deck-roof I was standing on, and two
female figures at the window&mdash;mere
dark shapes against the lamp. I almost
started back at the notion of
their seeing me, but away lengthened
the light on the breast of the swell,
and it sank slowly down into a black
hollow, as the Indiaman eased up to
windward. Minute by minute, quite
breathless, did I watch for such another
chance; but next time she leant over
as much, the port had been closed,
and all was dark; although those few
moments were enough to send the
heart into my mouth with sheer delight.
The figure I had seen holding with one
hand by the portsill, and apparently
keeping up her dress with the other,
as if she were looking down steadily
on the heave of the sea below&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
couldn't be mistaken. The line of
her head, neck, and shoulders, came
out more certain than if they hadn't
been filled up with nothing but a black
shadow; it was just Lota Hyde's, as
she sat in the ball-room amongst the
crowd, I'd have bet the Victory to a
bumboat on it: only her hair hung
loose on one side, while the girl behind
seemed to be dressing the other,
for it was turned back, so that I saw
clear past her cheek and neck to where
the lamp was, and her ear gleamed to
the light. For one moment nothing
could be plainer, than the glimpse
old Davy Jones gave me by one of his
tricks; but the old fellow was quite
as decorous in his way as a chamberblind,
and swallowed his pretty little
bit of blab as quickly as if it had been
a mermaid caught at her morning toilet.
Whenever I found there was to be no
more of it for the night, the best thing
to calm one's feelings was to light a
cigar and walk out the watch; but I
took care it should rather be over the
nabob's head than his daughter's,
and went up to the weather side, where
there was nobody else by this time,
wishing her the sweetest of dreams,
and not doubting I should see her
next day.</p>

<p>I daresay I should have walked out
the first watch, and the second too,
if Westwood hadn't come up beside
me before he turned in.</p>

<p>"Why, you look like the officer of
the watch, Ned!" said my friend,
after taking a glance, round at the
night. "Yes&mdash;what?&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I don't
think so," stammered I, not knowing
what he said, or at least the meaning
of it, though certainly it was not so
deep. "I hope not though, Tom!" said
I again, "'tis the very thing I don't
want to look like!" "You seem
bent on keeping it up, and coming
the innocent, at any rate," said he;
"I really didn't know you the first
time I saw you in the cuddy." "Why,
man, you never saw our theatricals in
the dear old Iris, on the African station!
I was our best female actor of
tragedy there, and <i>did</i> Desdemona so
well that the black cook who stood for
Othello, actually cried. He said, 'Nobody
but 'ee dibble umself go forsmudder
missee Dasdemoner!'" "I daresay,"
said Westwood; "but what is
the need for it <i>now</i>, even if <i>you</i> could
serve as a blind for me?" "My dear
fellow!" said I, "not at all&mdash;you've
kept it up very well so far&mdash;just go
on." "Keep it up, Ned?" inquired he,
"what do you mean? I've done nothing
except keep quiet, from mere
want of spirits." "So much the better,"
I said; "I never saw a man look more
like a prophet in the wilderness; it
doesn't cost you the least trouble&mdash;why
you'd have done for Hamlet in the Iris,
if for nothing else! After all, though, a
missionary don't wear blue pilot-cloth
trousers, nor tie his neckerchief as you
do, Tom. You must bend a white
neckcloth to-morrow morning! I'm
quite serious, Westwood, I assure
you," continued I. "Just think of
the suspicious look of two navy men
being aboard an <i>Indiaman</i>, nobody
knows how! Why, the first frigate we
speak, or port we touch at, they'd
hand one or both of us over at once&mdash;which
I, for my part, shouldn't at all
like!" "Indeed, Collins," said Tom,
turning round, "I really cannot understand
<i>why</i> you went out in her!
It distresses me to think that here
you've got yourself into this scrape
on my account! At least you'll put
back in the first home-bound ship
we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed I, blushing a
little in the dark though, both at
Westwood's simplicity and my not
wishing to tell him my secret yet&mdash;"I'm
tired of shore&mdash;I <i>want</i> to see
India again&mdash;I'm thinking of going
into the <i>army</i>, curse it!" "The <i>army</i>,
indeed!" said Westwood, laughing for
the first time, "and you midshipman
all over. No&mdash;no&mdash;that won't do! I
see your drift, you can't deceive <i>me</i>!
You're a true friend, Ned,&mdash;to stand
by an old schoolmate so!" "No,
Tom!" said I; "'tis yourself has too
kind a heart, and more of a sailor's,
all fair and above-board, than I can
manage! I <i>won't</i> humbug <i>you</i>, at any
rate&mdash;I tell you I've got a scheme of
my own, and you'll know more of it
soon." Tom whistled; however I
went on to tell him, "The long and the
short of it is, Westwood, you'll bring
both of us by the head if you don't
keep up the missionary." "Missionary!"
repeated he; "you don't mean to
say you and Neville intended all that
long toggery you supplied my kit with,
for me to sail under <i>missionary</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
colours? I tell you what, Ned, it's
not a character I like to cut jokes
upon, much less to sham!" "Jokes!"
said I; "there's no joking about it;
'tis serious enough." "Why," said
Westwood, "<i>now</i> I know the reason
of a person like a clergyman sighting
me through his spectacles for half an
hour together, these two evenings below!
This very afternoon he called me
his brother, and began asking me all
manner of questions which I could no
more answer than the cook's mate."
"Clergyman be hanged!" said I,
"you must steer clear of him, Tom&mdash;take
care you don't bowse up your jib
too much within hail of him! Mind,
I gave your name, both to the head-steward
and the skipper, as the Reverend
Mr Thomas, going back to
Bombay." "The devil you did!"
"Why there was nothing else for it,
Westwood," I said, "when you were
beyond thinking for yourself. All
you've got to do with that solemn chap
in the spectacles, is just to look as
wise as possible, and let him know you
belong to the <i>Church</i>. And as for shamming,
you needn't sham a bit&mdash;<i>taketoit</i>
my dear fellow, if that will do you good!"
I said this in joke, but Westwood
seemed to ponder on it for a minute
or two. "Indeed, Collins," said he
gravely, "I <i>do</i> think you're right.
What do we sailors do, but give up
everything in life for a mere schoolboy
notion, and keep turning up salt
water for years together like the old
monks did the ground; only they grew
corn and apples for their pains, and we
have nothing but ever so many dull
watches and wild cruises ashore to remember!
How many sailors have
turned preachers and missionaries, just
because something, by accident as it
were, taught them to put to account
what you can't help feeling now and
then in the very <i>look</i> of the sea? What
does it mean in the Scriptures, Ned,
about 'seeing the wonders of the Lord
in the deep?'" As Westwood said this,
both of us stopped on the taffrail, and,
somehow or other, a touch of I didn't
well know <i>what</i> went through me. I
held my breath, with his hand on my
arm, just at the sight I had seen a thousand
times&mdash;the white wake running
broad away astern, with a mark in the
middle as if it had been torn, on to the
green yeast of the waves, then right
to their black crests plunging in the
dark. It was midnight ahead, and the
clouds risen aloft over where I had
been looking half all hour before; but
the long ragged split to westward was
opened up, and a clear glaring glance
of the sky, as pale as death, shot through
it on the horizon. "I can't be sorry
for having gone to sea," said Westwood
again; "but isn't it a better
thing to leave home and friends, as
those men do, for the sake of carrying
the gospel to the heathen?" As soon
as we wheeled round, with the ship
before us, leaning over and mounting
to the heave, and her spread of canvass
looming out on the dark, my
thoughts righted. "Well," said I,
"it may be all very well for some&mdash;every
one to his rope; but, for my
part, I think if a man hadn't been
made for the sea, he couldn't have
built a ship, and where would your
missionaries be <i>then</i>? You're older
than I am, Westwood, or I'd say you
let some of your notions run away
with you, like a Yankee ship with
her short-handed crew!" "Oh, Ned,"
said he, "of all places in the world
for one's actions coming back on him
the sea is the worst, especially when
you're an idler, and have nothing to
do but count the sails, or listen to the
passengers' feet on deck. These two
days, now, I've thought more than I
ever did in my life. I can't get that
man's death out of my head; every
time, the sea flashes round me as I
come from below, I think of him&mdash;it
seems to me he is lying yet by the
side of the Channel. I can't help having
the notion he perhaps <i>fired in the
air</i>!" "'Twas a base lie!" said I;
"If <i>he</i> weren't <i>there</i>, you wouldn't be
here, I call tell you, Westwood." "I
don't know how I shall ever drag
through this voyage," continued he.
"If there were a French gunboat to
cut out to-morrow morning, or if we
were only to have a calm some day in
sight of a Spanish slaver,&mdash;'tis nothing
but a jogging old Indiaman though!
I shall never more see the flag over
my head with pride&mdash;every prospect
I had was in the service!"</p>

<p>Next morning was fine, and promised
to be hot; the ship still with a
sidewind from near south-west, which
'twas easy to see had slackened since
midnight with a pour of rain, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
sails being all wet, and coats hung
to dry in the fore-rigging; she was
going little more than five or six
knots headway. The water was
bluer, lifting in long waves, scarce a
speck of foam except about the ship;
but instead of having broke up with
the sun, or sunk below the level, the
long white clouds were risen high to
leeward, wandering away at the top
and facing us steady below out of the
sky, a pretty sure sign they had more
to do. However, the Indiaman was
all alive from stem to stern: decks
drying as clean as a table; hens and
ducks clucking in the coops at their
food; pigs grunting; stewards and
cabin-boys going fore and aft, below
and above, and the men from aloft
coming slowly down for breakfast,
with an eye into the galley funnel.
Most of the passengers were upon
deck, in knots all along the poop-nettings,
to look out for Corvo and Flores,
the westernmost of the Azores, which
we had passed before daybreak.</p>

<p>"I say, Fawd!" said the warlike
cadet with the mustache, all of a
sudden yawning and stretching himself,
as if he'd been struck with the
thing himself, "Cussed dull this
vessel already, ain't it?" "Blast
me, no, you fellow!" said Ford, the
nautical man&mdash;"that's because you're
not interested in the ocean&mdash;the sea&mdash;as
I am! You should study the
<i>craft</i>, Bob, my boy! I'll teach you to go
aloft. I only wish it would blow harder&mdash;not
a mere capful of wind, you know,
but a tempest!" "By Jove! Fawd,"
said the other, "<i>how</i> we <i>shall</i> enjoy
India&mdash;even that breakfast with old
Rollock! By the bye, ain't breakfast
ready yet?" These two fellows, for
my part, I took for a joint-model, just
trying to hit a mid-helm betwixt
them, else I couldn't have got through
it: accordingly they both patronised
me. "Haw, Cawlins!" said one,
nodding to me. "Is that you, my
boy?" said the other; "now you're
a fellow <i>never</i> would make a sailor!"
"I daresay not," I said, gravely, "if
they have all to commence as horse-marines."
"Now, such ignorance!"
said Ford; "marines don't ride horses,
Collins, you fellow!&mdash;how d'you think
they could be <i>fed</i> at sea&mdash;eh?"
"Well&mdash;now&mdash;that didn't occur to
me!" said I, in the cadet key. "Fawd,
my boy, you&mdash;demmee&mdash;you know
too much&mdash;you're quite a sea-cook!"
"Oh, now! But I'm afraid, Winterton,
I never shall land ashore in India&mdash;I
<i>am</i> tempted to go into the navy
instead." "I say, Mr Ford," put in
a fat unlicked cub of a tea-middy,
grinning as he listened, "I've put you
up to a few <i>rises</i> aboard, but I don't
think I told you we've got a dozen or
so of <i>donkeys</i><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> below in the steerage?"
"Donkeys!&mdash;no?" said the griffin.
"Yes," replied the midshipman;
"they kick like blazes, though, if they
get loose in a gale&mdash;why mine, now,
would knock a hole through the side
in no time&mdash;I'll show you them for a
glass of grog, Mr Ford." "Done!"
and away they went. "That fool,
Fawd, you know, Cawlins, makes one
sick with his stuff; I declare he chews
little bits of tobacco in our room till
he vomits as much as before," said
Winterton. "I tell you what, Cawlins,
you're a sensible man&mdash;I'll let
you into a secret! What do you
think&mdash;there's the deucedest pretty
girl in the vessel, we've none of us
seen except myself; I caught a sight
of her this very mawning. She don't
visit the cuddy at all; papa's proud,
you pusseeve&mdash;a nabob in short!"
"Oh, dear!" said I. "Yes, I do
assure you, quite a bew-ty! What's
to be done?&mdash;we absolutely must meet
her&mdash;eh, Cawlins?" Here I mused
a bit. "Oh!" said I, looking up
again, "shall we send a deputation,
do you think?" "Or get up a ball,
Cawlins?&mdash;Hallo, what's this?" said
he, leaning over the breast-rail to
look at a stout lady who was lugging
a chubby little boy of three or four,
half-dressed, up the poop-stair, while
her careful husband and a couple of
daughters blocked it up above. "See,
Tommy, dear!" said she, "look at
the <i>land</i>&mdash;the nice, land, you know,
Tommy." "Come away, my love,"
said her spouse, "else you won't see it."
Tommy, however, hung back manfully.
"Tommy don't want wook
at <i>yand</i>," sang out he, kicking the
deck; "it all such 'mell of a sheep,
ma; me wook at 'at man wis <i>gate
feel</i>. Fare other <i>feel</i>, man? Oh, fat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>a ugwy man!" The honest tar at the
wheel pulled up his shirt, and looked
terribly cut at this plain remark on
his phiz, which certainly wasn't the
most beautiful; meanwhile he had
the leech of the main to'gallant sail
shaking. "Mind your helm, there,"
sung out the second mate from the
capstan. "My good man," said the
lady, "will you be so kind as to show
us the land?" "Ay, ay, sir," growled
he, putting up his weather spokes;
"sorry I carn't, ma'am&mdash;please not to
speak to the man at the wheel."
Jacobs was coiling down the ropes on
a carronade close by, and stepped
forward: "Beg your ladyship's pardon,"
said he, but if ye'll give me
charge o' the youngster till you goes
on the poop&mdash;why, I've got a babby
at home myself." The stout lady
handed him over, and Jacobs managed
the little chap wonderfully. This was
the first time Tommy had been on
deck since leaving home, and he
couldn't see over the high bulwarks,
so he fancied it was a house he was
in. "Oh, suts big <i>tees, man</i>!" shouted
he, clapping his hands as soon as he
noticed the sails and rigging aloft;
"suts warge birds in a <i>tees</i>!" "Ay,
ay, my little man," answered Jacobs,
"that's the wonderfowl <i>tree</i>! Did
ye ever hear Jack and the Bean-stalk,
Tommy?" "Oh, 'ess, to be soo,
<i>man</i>!" said Tommy, scornfully, as if
he should think he had. "Well,
little un," said Jacobs, "that's it, ye
see. It grows up every night afore
Jack's door&mdash;and them's Jack an'
his brothers a-comin' down out on the
wonderfowl country aloft, with fruits
in their hands." The little fellow was
delighted, and for going aloft at once.
"Ye must wait a bit, Tommy, my
lad, till you're bigger," said Jacobs;
"here I'll show you the country,
though;" so he lifted the boy up to
let him see the bright blue sea lying
high away round the sky. In place
of crying, as he would have done otherwise,
Tommy stared with pleasure,
and finished by vowing to get as soon
big as possible, Jacobs advising him
to eat always as hard as he had been
doing hitherto.</p>

<p>This morning the breakfast party
was in high spirits: Mr Finch, the
chief officer, rigged up to the nines
in white trowsers and Company's
jacket, laying himself out to please
the young ladies, with whom he began
to be a regular hero. He was
as blustering as a young lion, and as
salt-tongued as a Channel pilot to
the men; but with the ladies, on the
poop or in the cabin, he was always
twisting his sea-talk into fine language,
like what you see in books,
as if the real thing weren't good
enough. He rubbed his hands at
hearing the mate on deck singing out
over the skylight to trim yards,
and gave a look along to the captain.
"You must understand, ladies," said
the mate, "this is what we mariners call
the 'ladies' wind!'" "Oh delightful!"
"Oh <i>so</i> nice!" "You sailors
<i>are</i> so polite!" exclaimed the young
ladies&mdash;"then does it actually <i>belong</i>
to us?" "Why it's a <i>Trade</i> wind, Miss
Fortescue!" said Ford the nautical
cadet, venturing to put in a word; but
the ladies paid no attention to him,
and the chief mate gave him a look of
contempt. "You see, ladies, the
reason is," said the mate, in a flourishing
way, "because it's so regular,
and as gentle as&mdash;as&mdash;why it wafts
your bark into the region of, you
see,&mdash;the&mdash;" "The 'Doldrums,'"
put in the third mate, who was a
brinier individual by far, and a true
seaman, but wished to pay his compliments
too, between his mouthfuls.
"At any rate," Finch went on, "it's
congenial, I may say, to the feelings
of the fair&mdash;you need never touch her
braces from one day to another. I
just wish, Miss Fortescue, you'd allow
me the felicity of letting you see how
to put the ship about!" "A <i>soldier</i>
might put her in stays, miss," said the
third mate again, encouragingly, "and
out of 'em again; she's a remarkable
easy craft, owing to her&mdash;&mdash;" "Confound
it! Mr Rickett," said the first
mate, turning round to his unlucky
inferior, "you're a sight too coarse
for talking to ladies. Well the captain
didn't hear you!" Rickett looked
dumbfounded, not knowing what
was wrong; the old ladies frowned;
the young ones either blushed or put
their handkerchiefs to their mouths,
and some took the occasion for walking
off.</p>

<p>The weather began to have a different
turn already by the time we
got up&mdash;the clouds banking to lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>ward,
the sea dusky under them, and
the air-line between rather bluish.
Two or three lazy gulls in our wake
began to look alive, and show themselves,
and a whole black shoal of porpoises
went tumbling and rolling across
the bows for half an hour, till down
they dived of a sudden, head-foremost,
one after another in the same spot,
like so many sheep through a gap.</p>

<p>My gentleman-mate was to be seen
everywhere about the decks, and active
enough, I must say: the next
minute he was amongst two or three
young ladies aft, as polite as a dancing-master,
showing them everything
in board and out, as if nobody
knew it except himself. Here
a young girl, one of Master Tommy's
sisters, came skipping aft, half in a
fright. "Oh, Miss Fortescue!" cried
she, "just think!&mdash;I peeped over
into a nasty black hole there, with a
ladder in it, and saw ever so many
common sailors hung up in bags from
the ceiling. Oh, what do you think,
one of them actually kissed his hand
to me!" "Only one of the watch
below awake, Miss," said the mate;
"impertinent swab!&mdash;I only wish I
knew which it was." "Poor fellows!"
said the young ladies; "pray,
don't be harsh to them&mdash;but what
have they been doing?" "Oh, nothing,"
said he, with a laugh, "but
swing in their hammocks since eight
bells." "Then are they so lazy as
to dislike getting up to such delightful-looking
occupations?" "Why,
ma'am," said the mate, staring a
little, "they've been on deck last
night two watches, of four hours each,
I must say that for them." "Dear
me!" broke out the ladies; and on
this the chief officer took occasion to
launch out again concerning "the
weary vigils," as he called them,
"which we mariners have to keep, far
distant from land, without a smile from
the eyes of the fair to bless us! But,
however, the very thought of it gives
courage to the sailor's manly heart, to
disregard the billows' fearful rage, and
reef topsails in the tempest's angry
height!" Thought I, "he'd much
better do it before." However, the
young ladies didn't seem to see that,
evidently looking upon the mate as
the very pink of seamen; and he
actually set a second lower stud-sail,
to show them how fast she could
walk.</p>

<p>"D'ye know, sir," put in the third
mate, coming from forward, "I'm in
doubt it's going to be rather a sneezer,
sir, if ye look round the larboard
stuns'ls." Sure enough, if our fine
gentleman had had time, amidst his
politeness, just to cast an eye beyond
his spread of cloth, he would have noticed
the clouds gathered all in a lump
to north-eastward, one shooting into
another&mdash;the breast of them lowering
down to the horizon, and getting the
same colour as the waves, till it bulked
out bodily in the middle. You'd have
fancied the belly of it scarce half a mile
off from the white yard-arms, and the
hollow of it twenty&mdash;coming as stealthily
as a ghost, that walks without
feet after you, its face to yours, and
the skirt of its winding-sheet in
"kingdom come" all the while. I
went up on the poop, and away behind
the spanker I could see the sun
gleam for one minute right on the eye
of stray cloud risen to nor'-west,
with two short streaks of red, purple,
and yellow together&mdash;what is called
a "wind-gall;" then it was gone. The
American was talking away with jovial
old Rollock and Ford, who began
to look wise, and think there was mischief
brewing in the weather. "Mind
your helm there, sirrah!" sung out
the mate, walking aft to the wheel,
as everything aloft fluttered. "She
won't lie her course, sir!" said the
man. "All aback for'ud!" hailed
the men at work on the bowsprit;
and hard at it went all hands, trimming
yards over and over again; the
wind freshening fast, stunsails flapping,
booms bending, and the whole
spread of canvass in a cumber, to
teach the mate not to be in such a
hurry with his infernal merchantman's
side-wings next time. The last stunsail
he hauled down caught full aback
before the wheel could keep her away
quick enough; the sheet of it hitched
foul at the boom-end, and crack
through went the boom itself, with a
smash that made the ladies think it a
case of shipwreck commencing. The
loose scud was flying fast out from
behind the top of the clouds, and
spreading away overhead, as if it
would catch us on the other side;
while the clouds themselves broke up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
slowly to both hands, and the north-east
breeze came sweeping along right
into the three topsails, the wind one
way and the sea another. As she
rounded away steadying before it, you
felt the masts shake in her till the
topsails blew out full; she gave one
sudden bolt up with her stern, like an
old jackass striking behind, which
capsized three or four passengers in a
heap; and next minute she was surging
along through the wide heave of
the water as gallantly as heart could
wish, driving a wave under her bows
that swung back under the forechains
on both sides, with two boys running
up the rigging far aloft on each mast
to stow the royals. The next thing
I looked at was poor Ford's nautical
hat lifting alongside on the top of a
wave, as if it were being handed up
to him; but no sooner seen, than it
was down in the hollow a quarter of
a mile off, a couple of white gulls
making snatches at it and one another,
and hanging over it again with
a doubtful sort of a scream. Still the
wind was as yet nothing to speak of
when once aft; the sea was getting up
slowly, and the Indiaman's easy roll
over it made every one cheerful, in
spite of the shifts they were put to
for getting below. When the bell
struck for dinner, the sun was pretty
clear, away on our starboard bow; the
waves to south-westward glittered as
they rose; one side of the ship shone
bright to the leech of the mainto'gallant-sail,
and we left the second mate
hauling down the jibs for want of use
for them.</p>

<p>The splendid pace she went at was
plain, below in the cuddy, to everybody;
you felt her shoving the long
seas aside with the force of a thousand
horses in one, then sweep they came
after her, her stern lifted, she rolled
round, and made a floating rush ahead.
In the middle of it all, something darkened
the half-open skylight, where I
perceived the Scotch second-mate's
twisted nose and red whiskers, as he
squinted down with one eye aloft, and
disappeared again; after which I heard
them clue up to'gallant-sails. Still
she was driving through it rather too
bodily to let the seas rise under her;
you <i>heard</i> the wind hum of the main-topsail,
and sing through betwixt it
and the main-course, the scud flying
over the skysail-mast truck, which I
could see from below. The second
mate looked in once more, caught the
first officer's eye with a glance aloft,
and the gallant mate left attending to
the ladies to go on deck. Down went
the skylight frame, and somebody carefully
threw a tarpaulin over it, so that
there was only the light from the port-windows,
by which a dozen faces
turned still whiter.</p>

<p>The moment I shoved my head out
of the booby-hatch, I saw it was like to
turn out a regular gale from nor'-east.
Both courses brailed close-up, and
blowing out like rows of big-bladders;
the three topsail-yards down on the
caps to reef, their canvass swelling and
thundering on the stays like so many
mad elephants breaking loose; the
wild sky ahead of us staring right
through in triumph, as it were, and
the wind roaring from aft in her
bare rigging; while a crowd of men in
each top were laying out along the
foot-ropes to both yard-arms. Below,
they were singing out at the reef-tackles,
the idlers tailing on behind
from the cook to the cabin-boys, a
mate to each gang, and the first officer
with his hands to his mouth before the
wheel, shouting "Bear a hand!&mdash;d'ye
hear!&mdash;two reefs!" It did one's heart
good, and I entered into the spirit of
it, almost forgiving Finch his fine
puppy lingo, when I saw him take it
so coolly, standing like a seaman, and
sending his bull's voice right up with
the wind into the bellies of the topsails&mdash;so
I e'en fell-to myself, and
dragged with the steward upon the
mizen reef-tackle till it was chock up.
There we were, running dead before
it, the huge waves swelling long and
dark after us out of the mist, then the
tops of them scattered into spray; the
glaring white yards swayed slowly
over aloft, each dotted with ten or a
dozen sturdy figures, that leant over
with the reef-points in their hands,
waiting till the men at the <i>earings</i>
gave the word; and Jacobs's face, as
he looked round to do so&mdash;hanging on
heaven knows what at one of the ends&mdash;was
as distinct as possible against the
gray scud miles off, and sixty feet
above the water. A middy, without
his cap, and his hair blowing out,
stood holding on in the main-top to
quicken them; the first mate waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
his hand for the helmsman to "luff a
little." The ship's head was rounding
slowly up as she rose on a big blue
swell, that caught a wild gleam on it
from westward, when I happened to
glance towards the wheel. I could
scarcely trust my eyes&mdash;in fact it had
never been less in my mind since
coming aboard than at that very point&mdash;but
outside one of the round-house
doors, which was half open, a few feet
from the bulwark I leant over&mdash;of all
moments in the day, <i>there</i> stood Lota
Hyde herself at last! Speak of faces!&mdash;why,
I hadn't even power to turn farther
round, and if I was half out of
breath before, what with the wind and
with pulling my share, I was breathless
now&mdash;all my notions of her never
came up to the look of her face at that
instant! She just half stopped, as it
were, at sight of the state of things,
her hands letting go of the large shawl,
and her hair streaming from under a
straw hat tied down with a ribbon&mdash;her
lips parted betwixt dread and bewilderment,
and her eyes wandering
round till they settled a-gazing straight
at the scene ahead, in pure delight. I
actually looked away aloft from her
again, to catch what it was she seemed
to see that could be so beautiful!&mdash;the
second reef just made fast, men crowding
in to run down and hoist away
with the rest, till, as they tailed along
decks, the three shortened topsails
rose faster up against the scud, and
their hearty roaring chorus was as
loud as the gale. "Keep her away,
my lad!" said the mate, with another
wave of his hand; the topsails swelled
fair before it, and the Indiaman gave
a plunge right through the next sea,
rising easily to it, heave after heave.
The setting sun struck two or three
misty spokes of his wheel through
a cloud, that made a big wave here
and there glitter; the ship's white
yards caught some of it, and a row of
broad backs, with their feet stretching
the foot-rope as they stowed the foresail,
shone bright out, red, blue, and
striped, upon the hollow of the yellow
fore-topsail, in the midst of the gale;
while just under the bowsprit you saw
her black figure-head, with his white
turban, and his hand to his breast,
giving a cool salaam now and then to
the spray from her bows. At that
moment, though, Lota Hyde's eye was
the brightest thing I could find&mdash;all
the blue gone out of the waves was in
it. As for her seeing myself, I hadn't
had space to think of it yet, when all
of a sudden I noticed her glance light
for the first time, as it were, on the
mate, who was standing all the while
with his back to her, on the same plank
of the quarterdeck. "Down main-course!"
he sung out, putting one hand
in his jacket-pocket; "down both tacks&mdash;that's
it, my men&mdash;down with it!"&mdash;and
out it flapped, slapping fiercely
as they dragged it by main force into
the bulwark-cleats, till it swelled steady
above the main-stay, and the old ship
sprang forward faster than before,
with a wild wash of the Atlantic past
her sides. "Another hand to the
wheel, here!" said the first officer.
He took a look aloft, leaning to the
rise of her bows, then to windward as
she rolled; everything looked trim
and weatherly, so he stepped to the
binnacle, where the lamp was ready
lighted, and it just struck me what a
smart, good-looking fellow the mate
was, with his sun-burnt face; and
when he went to work, straight-forward,
no notion of showing off. "Confound
it, though!" thought I of a
sudden, seeing <i>her</i> eyes fixed on him
again, and then to seaward. "Mr
Macleod," said he to the second mate,
"send below the watch, if you please.
This breeze is first-rate, though!"
When he turned round, he noticed
Miss Hyde, started, and took off his
cap with a fine bow. "I beg pardon,
ma'am," said he, "a trifle of wind we
have! I hope, Miss Hyde, it hasn't
troubled you in the round-house?"
What Miss Hyde might have said I
don't know, but her shawl caught a
gust out of the spanker, though she
was in the lee of the high poop; it
blew over her head, and then loose&mdash;I
sprang forward&mdash;but the mate had
hold of it, and put it over her again.
The young lady smiled politely to the
mate, and gave a cold glance of surprise,
as I thought, at me. I felt, that
moment, I could have knocked the
mate down and died happy. "Why,
sir," said he, with a cool half sneer,
"I fancied none of you gentlemen
would have favoured us this capful of
wind&mdash;plenty of air there is on deck,
though." It just flashed through my
mind what sort of rig I was in&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
looked over my infernal 'long-shore
toggery, and no wonder she didn't
recollect me at all! "<i>Curse</i> this
confounded folly!" muttered I, and
made a dart to run up the poop-steps,
where the breeze took me slap aback,
just as the judge himself opened the
larboard door. "Why, Violet!" exclaimed
he, surprised at seeing his
daughter, "are you exposing yourself
to this disagreeable&mdash;I declare a perfect
<i>storm</i>!" "But see, papa!" said
she, taking hold of his arm, "how
changed the sea is!&mdash;and the ship!&mdash;just
look where the sun was!" "Get in&mdash;get
in, do!" kept on her father; "you
can see all that again in some finer
place; you should have had a servant
with you, at least, Violet." "I shall
come out oftener than I thought, papa,
I can tell you!" said she, in an arch
sort of way, before she disappeared.
The mate touched his cap to the judge,
who asked where the captain was.
"'Gad sir," said the judge crossly,
"the floor resembles an earthquake&mdash;every
piece of furniture swings,
sir; 'tis well enough for sleeping,
but my family find it impossible
to dine. If this <i>oolta-poolta</i> continues
in my apartments, I must speak
to Captain Williamson about it! He
must manage to get into some other
part of the sea, where it is less rough,"
saying which he swayed himself in
and shut the door. I still kept thinking
and picturing <i>her</i> face&mdash;Lota
Hyde's&mdash;when she noticed the mate.
After all, any one that knew tack
from bowline might reef topsails in a
fair wind; but a girl like <i>that</i> would
make more count of a man knowing
how to manage wind and sea, than of
the Duke on his horse at Waterloo
beating Bonaparte; and as for talk, he
would jaw away the whole voyage, no
doubt, about moonlight and the ocean,
and your genteel fancy mariners! "By
George, though!" thought I, "if the
mate's a better man than me, hang
me&mdash;it's all right; but burn my wig
if I don't go and turn a Hindoo fakeer,
with my one arm stuck up in the air
till I die! Go it, old lady!" said
I, as I glanced over the side before
going below for the night, "roll away,
only shake something or other to <i>do</i>
out of the pace you're going at!"</p>

<p>The next morning, when Westwood
and I went on deck, there was still a
long sea running after us. However,
by noon the sun came sifting through
aloft, the breeze got warm, the decks
were dry as a bone, and one just saw
the large dark-blue swells lift up
alongside with a shower of spray, between
the seams of the bulwarks. By
six o'clock, again, it was got pretty
dusk ahead, and I strolled forward
right to the heel of the bowsprit,
with Westwood, looking down through
her head-boards into the heap of
white foam that washed up among
the woodwork every time she plunged.
One knot of the men were sitting
with their legs over the break of the
top-gallant forecastle, swinging as
she rolled&mdash;laughing, roaring, and
singing as loud as they could bawl,
since the wind carried it all forward
out of the officers' hearing. I
was rather surprised to see and hear
that Jacobs's friends, Bill Dykes and
Tom, were there: the rogues were taking
back their savage to the Andaman
Isles again, I suppose. "Well,
my lads," said Tom, a regular sample
of the man-o'-war's-man: "this
is what I calls balling it off! That
mate knows how to make her go, any
how!" "We'll soon be into tropical
regents, I consider!" remarked Bill,
who made a point of never using sea-phrases
except ashore, when he came
out double salt, to make up for his
gentility afloat. "Hum," grumbled
a big ugly fellow, the same so flattered
at the wheel by little Tommy, "I
doesn't like your fair winds! I'll tell
you what, mates, we'll be havin' it
puff more from east'ard ere third
watch." "What's the odds, Harry,
old ship?" said Tom, "a fair wind
still!" "I say, my lads," exclaimed
Tom again, looking along toward the
poop, "yonder's the ould naboob
squinting out of the round-house
doors!&mdash;what's he after now, I wonder?"
On stooping down, accordingly,
I could see the judge's face
with the binnacle-light shining on it,
as he swayed to and fro in the doorway,
seemingly in a passion at something or
other. "Why," said Bill, "I consider
he can't altogether circumstand the
shindy as this here roll kicks up inside
of his blessed paliss!" "Nabob,
does ye call him!" said Harry, sulkily;
"I'll tell you what, 'mates, he ben't
nothin' but a reg'lar bloody ould<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
tyrant! T'other mornin' there, I
just chances to brush against him as
I kiles up a rope, says he '<i>Fellow!</i>'
an' says he to the skipper, 'I'd take
it kind,' says he, 'if ye'd horder them
commin sailors for to pay more contention
alongside o' <i>my</i> legs, Captin
Willumsen!' Why, do the old beggar
not think as a feller ben't a <i>man</i>
as well as hisself, with his <i>commin
sailors</i>, an' be blowed to him!"
"Well though, Harry, old ship," said
Tom, "an't that daurter of his'n a
jewel! I say, 'mates, she's all rounded
into the head, and a clear run from
aft, like a corvette model! My eye,
that hair of hers is worth gold; I'd go
down on the deck to please her, d'ye
see!" "No doubt," says Bill, "she's
what I call a exact sparkler!"
"Well, I doesn't know," said Harry.
"Last vy'ge but one we'd got one
aboard, a'most beautifuller&mdash;half as
high again, an' twice her beam&mdash;I'm
not sure but <i>she</i>&mdash;" "All my eye,
messmates!" broke in Tom; "that one
were built for <i>stowing</i>, ye see, bo',
like yer cargo lumpers. Now, this here
young gal minds me o' no other blessed
thing but the Nymph corvette's figure-head&mdash;and
that warn't her match,
neither! She don't look down upon
a sailor, I can tell ye; there I see her
t'other morning-watch a talkin' to
Jacobs yonder, as pleasant and cheery
as&mdash;&mdash;Hullo, there's the captain comed
out o' the naboob's cabin, and speaking
with the mate by the compass,&mdash;blessed
if they an't agoin' to alter her
course!"</p>

<p>"Send aft here to the braces!"
sung out the first officer to the boatswain.
"Blow me, shipmates, that's
yeer naboob now, I'll bet a week's
grog," growled Harry; "ship's course
as fair as a handspike through a
grummet; couldn't bring the wind
more aft; b&mdash;t my eyes, the sea's
comin' to be bought and sold!"
Whatever it might be <i>for</i>, in came the
starboard yard-arms till she lay over
a little; down studding and top-gallant
sails, as neither of them could
stand it except from aft; and off went
the old ship rising high athwart the
seas, her head sou'-south-east, and
one streak of broken yellow light, low
down to westward on her lee quarter.
It was beginning to blow harder, too,
and by eight bells it was "Reef topsails,
single reef!" The waves
played slap on her weather side, the
heavy sprays came showering over
her bulwarks forward, and the forecastle
planks were far from being so
comfortable for a snooze as the night
before. As soon as the wheel was
relieved, and the other watch below,
the "ugly man" and his companions
returned. "Mates," said he, solemnly,
planting his back against the bitts,
"I've sailed this five-and-twenty
year before the mast, an' I never
yet seed the likes o' <i>that</i>! Take my
say for it, we're <i>on</i> a wind now, but
afore next mornin' we'll be close-hauled,
beating up against it."
"Well," said another, "she leaks a
deal in the eyes of her below; in that
case, Harry, <i>your</i> watch as slings in
the fore-peak'll be all afloat by that
time." "What day did this here craft
sail on, I asks?" said the sailmaker
gravely. "Why, a Thursday night,
old ship," replied several eagerly.
"No," went on the sailmaker; "you
counts sea-fashion, shipmates; but
till ye're clear o' the pilot, ye know,
its land fashion ye ought for to go by.
'Twas a <i>Friday</i> by that 'ere said
reckoning, shipmates." "No! so it
was though," said the rest&mdash;"it don't
<i>look</i> well." "Howsomedever I'm
not goin' to come for to go and be
a croaker," continued the sailmaker
in a voice like a ghost's. "Well,
luck or no luck, 'mates," grumbled
big Harry, "if so be them larboard
bowlines is hauled taut by the morning
watch, blow me if I don't be upsides
with that 'ere bloody ould
naboob&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>Next morning, after all, it was easy
to feel the ship had really been hauled
close on a wind. When we went up, the
weather was clearing, though with a
strongish gale from eastward, a heavy
sea running, on which the Indiaman
strained and creaked as she rose,
rolling slowly to windward with her
three double-reefed topsails strained
full, then pitched head into it, as a
cloud of foam and spray flew over her
weather bow. It was quite early, the
decks lately washed down, and the Indian
judge walking the weather quarterdeck
as grave and comfortable as if
it was all right. The captain was
with him, and two mates to leeward.
"Sail O!" hailed a man on the fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>yard.
"Where away?" sung out
the mate of the watch. "Broad
abeam!" The captain went up to
the poop, and I stood on the foremost
carronade near the main rigging,
where I could just see her now and
then white against the blue haze between
the hollows of the waves, as
the Indiaman lifted. "There she is!"
said I, thinking it was Westwood that
stopped behind me; it was the judge,
however, and as soon as I got down
he stepped up, holding on with one
hand to a backstay. The ship was
rising after a pitch, every bulkhead and
timber in her creaking, when all of a
sudden I felt by my feet what all sailors
feel the same way&mdash;she was coming up
in the wind too fast to mount with the
next wave, and a regular <i>comber</i> it
was going to be. I looked to the
wheel&mdash;there was big Harry himself
with a grin on his face, and his eye
on Sir Charles, as he coolly gave her
half a weather-spoke more, and then
whirled it back again to meet her.
"For heaven's sake, look out, sir!"
exclaimed I. "Why so I do," said
the judge, rather good-naturedly.
"'Zounds! what's&mdash;" You felt the
whole ship stop creaking for a moment,
as she hung with the last wave&mdash;"Hold
on!" shouted a mid&mdash;she
gave a dull quiver from stem to stern,
and I fairly pulled the judge close into
the bulwark, just as smash, like thunder,
came a tremendous green sea
over us, three in one, washing down
into the lee scuppers. The old gentleman
staggered up, dripping like a
poodle, and unable to see&mdash;one heard
the water trickling through the skylights,
and stepping away down stairs
like a fellow with iron heels; while
there was the sailor at the wheel
grinding down his spokes in right
earnest, looking aloft at the shaking
fore-topsail, and the Indiaman seemingly
doubtful whether to fall off or
broach-to. Up she rose again, however,
and drove round with her Turk-head
in the air, then dip through the
spray as gallantly as ever. "Send
that lubber from the wheel, Mr Macleod!"
said the captain angrily, when
he came down, "he nearly broached
the ship to just now!" The "ugly
man" put on a double-gloomy face, and
grumbled something about her "steering
wild;" but the knowing squint he
gave Jacobs, who relieved him, was
enough to show me he was one of the
best helmsmen aboard. As for the
judge, he hadn't the least notion it
was anything more than a natural
mischance, owing to exposing himself.
He eyed the bulwark as if he couldn't
understand how any wave was able to
rise over it, while the captain was apologising,
and hoping he wouldn't be the
worse. "Eh, young gentleman!" said
Sir Charles of a sudden, turning round
to me, after a glance from the weather
side to the lee one, "now I observe
the circumstances, the probability is
I should have had myself severely
injured on the opposite side there, had
it not been for your presence of mind,
sir&mdash;eh?" Here I made a bow, and
looked as modest as I could. "I perceive
you are wet, young gentleman,"
said he again; "you'd better change
your dress&mdash;eh?" "Thank you, sir!"
I said; and as he walked off quite
drenched to his cabin, with the captain,
I heard him remark it was
"wonderfully intelligent in a mere
griffin."</p>

<p>However, the wind soon got down
to a fine top-gallant breeze; less of a
sea on, the clouds sunk in a long gray
bank to leeward, and the strange sail
plain abeam of us&mdash;a large ship steering
seemingly more off the wind than
the Seringapatam, with top-gallant-sails
set&mdash;you could just see the heads of
her courses, and her black lower-yards,
when both of us rose together. Our
first officer was all alive at the sight;
the reefs were out of our topsails
already, and he soon had us ploughing
along under ordinary canvass, though
still hugging the wind. In a short
time the stranger appeared to take
the challenge, for he slanted his yards,
clapped on royals, and hauled down a
stunsail, heading our course, till he
was one body of white cloth on the
horizon. For a while we seemed
to gain on her; but after dinner, there
was the other ship's hull up on our
lee-bow, rising her white streak out
of the water steadily, and just lifting
at times on the long blue seas: she
was fore-reaching on us, as plain as
could be. The mate gave a stamp on
the deck, and kept her away a little to
set a stunsail. "Why," said I to
Westwood, "he'll fall to leeward of
himself!" "She's too much <i>by the head</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Collins," said Westwood; "that's it!"
"Hasn't he the sense to take the fore-course
off her?" said I, "instead of
packing more <i>on</i>! Why, that craft
weathers on us like a schooner&mdash;I
wish you and I had the Indiaman for
an hour or two, Tom!" It wasn't an
hour before we could see the very
waves splashing up under her black
weather-side, and over her high bows, as
she slanted right through it and rose to
windward again, standing up to cross
our course&mdash;a fine frigate-built Indiaman,
sharper stemmed than her kind
in ordinary, and square in her spread;
one yardarm just looking over the other
as they ranged aloft, and all signs of a
weatherly craft. "That's the Duke o'
Bedford!" said a sailor at the braces
to his companions, "all oak planks,
and not a splinter of teak in <i>her</i>!
No chance!" Out flew the British
colours from her mizen-peak, and next
the Company's striped ensign at her
fore-royal-mast head, as a signal to
speak. However, the Seringapatam
only answered by showing her colours,
and held on. All of a sudden the
other Indiaman was seen slowly falling
off before the wind, as if in scorn
at such rude manners, and sure of
passing us if she chose. For a moment
the red sunset glanced through betwixt
all three of her masts, every
rope as fine as wire; then the canvass
swung broad against it, blood-red
from the sun, and she showed us her
quarter-gallery, with a glimpse of her
stern-windows glittering,&mdash;you even
made out the crowd of passengers
and soldiers on her poop, and a man
or two going up her rigging. The
sea beyond her lay as blue as blue
could be, what with the crimson
streak that came zig-zag on both sides
of her shadow, and gleamed along the
smooth troughs, taking a crest or two
to dance on by the way; and what
with the rough of it near at hand, where
the tops of the dark waves ran hither
and thither in broad white flakes, we
surging heavily over them.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the sun was
not only down, but the clouds banked
up to westward, of a deep purple; and
almost at once you saw nothing of the
other ship, except when a stray streak
somehow or other caught her rising,
or her mast-heads came across a pale
line in the clouds. The breeze got
pleasanter as the night went on, and
the Seringapatam rattled away in fine
style, careening to it by herself.</p>

<p>Well, you know, nothing could be
better for a good understanding and
high spirits amongst us than a fast
course, fine weather, and entering
the tropics. As for the tropics, if
you have only a roomy ship and a
good run of wind, as we had, in
those latitudes everything outside of
you seems almost to have double
the stuff in it that air and water
have in other places; while <i>inside</i> of
one, again, one felt twice the life he
had before, and everybody else came
out <i>newer</i> a good deal than on the
parlour rug at home. As the days
got each hotter than the last, and the
sea bluer and bluer, we began to
think better of the heavy old Seringapatam's
pace, teak though she was,
and her sole good point right before
the wind. Every night she lighted
her binnacle sooner, till deuce the bit
of twilight there was, and the dark
sky came down on us like the extinguisher
over a candle. However, the
looks of things round and aloft made
full amends for it, as long as we held
the "Trades;" old Neptune shifting his
scenes there so quickly, that nobody
missed getting weather and air, more
than he could help, were it only a
sight of how the Indiaman got on,
without trouble to any living soul
save the man at the wheel, as one
long, big, bright wave shoved her to
another, and the slower they rose the
more business she seemed to do of herself.
By the time they had furbished
her up at their leisure, the Seringapatam
had a queer Eastern style, too,
throughout; with her grass mattings
and husky <i>coir</i> chafing-gear, the yellow
varnish about her, and her three
topsails of country-canvass, cut narrow
towards the head&mdash;bamboo stunsail
booms, and spare bits of bamboo
always ready for everything; besides
the bilious-like gold-coloured patches
here and there in the rest of her sails,
and the outlandish figure-head, that
made you sometimes think there
might be twenty thousand of them under
the bows, dancing away with her
like Juggernaut's travelling pagoda.
The decks were lively enough to look
at; the men working quietly by twos
and threes about the bulwarks all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
long, and pairs of them to be made
out at different points aloft, yarning
away comfortably together, as the
one passed the ball for the other's
serving-mallet, with now a glance at
the horizon, and now a grin at the
passengers below, or a cautious squint
at the top of the mate's cap. White
awnings triced over poop and quarterdeck,
the cover of the waist hammock-netting
clean scrubbed, and the big
shady main-course half brailed-up,
rustling and bulging above the boats
and booms amidships; every hatchway
and door with a round funnel of
a wind-sail swelling into it, and their
bellies moving like so many boa-constrictors
come down from aloft, and
going in to catch cadets. You saw
the bright white sky dazzling along
under the awning-cheeks, that glared
on it like snow; and the open quarterdeck
ports let in so many squares
of shifting blue light, with a draught
of air into the hot carronade muzzles,
that seemed to gasp for it with their
red tompions stuck out like tongues.
The very look of the lifting blue water
on the shady side was refreshing, and
the brighter the light got, <i>it</i> grew the
darker blue. You listened for every
cool splash of it on the bends, and
every rustle of the canvass aloft; and
instead of thinking, as the landsmen
did, of green leaves and a lazy nook
for shelter, why, to my fancy there's
a deuced sigh more satisfaction in
good <i>dark blue</i>, with a spray over
the cat-head to show you're going,
and with somewhat to go for! For
want of better, one would have given
his ears to jump in head-foremost,
and have a first-rate bathe&mdash;the very
sea itself kept rising up alongside to
make an easy dive for one, and sinking
into little round troughs again,
where the surges would have sprinkled
over your head. Now and then a
bigger wave than ordinary would go
swelling up, and out sprang a whole
glittering shower of flying-fish, freckling
the dark side with drops, and
went flittering over into the next, or
skimming the crests out of sight into
a hollow. The writers and cadets
were in high feather at knowing
they were in the same latitude as
India, and appeared in all sorts of
straw hats, white trousers, and white
jackets. Ford had left off talking
of going aloft for a while, to
flourish about his swimming&mdash;when
he looked over with the surgeon into
the smooth of a hollow, and saw
something big and green, like all immense
cucumber, floating along within
a fathom or two of the ship, deep
down in the blue water. While the
griffin asked what it was, a little
ripple broke above, a wet black horn
came right out of it, and two devilish
round eyes glared up at us ahead of
it, as we leant over the quarter, set
wide in a broad black snout, shaped
like a gravedigger's shovel; then it
sank away into the next wave. Ford
shivered, in spite of the heat. "The
devil?" inquired one of the writers,
coolly, to the surgeon. "Not just
him," said the Scotchman; "it's only
the first <i>shark</i>!"</p>

<p>The young ladies, in their white
dresses, now made you think of angels
gliding about: as to the only one I
had an eye for, by this time it wasn't
of not seeing her often enough I had
to complain, as she seemed to delight
in nothing else but being somewhere
or other upon deck; first one part of
the ship, then another, as if to see
how different the look-out could be
made, or to watch something in the
waves or the horizon. Instead of sitting
with a needle or a book, like the
rest, with the corner of one eye toward
the gentlemen, or talking and
giggling away at no allowance, she
would be noticing a man aloft as if
she were there herself, or trying to
see past a sail, as if she fancied there
was something strange on the other
side of it. The rest of the girls appeared
shy of her at first, no doubt
on account of the Judge's separate
quarters and his grandee style; next,
they made acquaintance, she speaking
and smiling just as if she had known
them before; then, again, most of
them seemingly got jealous because
the cadets squinted after her; while
old Rollock said Miss Hyde would be
the beauty on Chowringee Course,
and the first officer was eternally
pointing out things to her, like a showman
at a fair. However, she seemed
not to mind it at all, either way:
those that did talk to her would scarce
hear her answer ere they lost her, and
there she was, looking quietly down
by herself into the ripples alongside;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a minute after, she would be half-playing
with little Tommy, and making
companions of Tommy's young
sisters, to see the sheep, the pigs, and
the cow, or feed the poultry. As for
the handsome "first officer," when he
caught occasion for his politeness, she
took it graciously enough, and listened
to all he said; till, of a sudden, a smile
would break over her face, and she
seemed to me to put him off as easy
as a duchess&mdash;on the score, it might
be, of the Judge's looking for her off
the poop, or something else of the
kind. 'Twas the more curious how
much at home she seemed amongst
the men at work, when she chanced
to go "forward" with Tommy and
his sisters, as they skipped hither
and thither: the rough, blue-shirted
fellows took the quids out of their
cheeks as soon as they saw the party
coming from aft, and began to smirk,
shoving the tar-buckets and ropes
aside. One forenoon, an old lady
under the poop awning, where she and
her daughter were sewing together at a
bright strip of needlework, asked me
to hold her woollen yarns for her as
she balled them off&mdash;being the red coat
for a sepoy killing a tiger, which her
daughter was making in yellow. I
couldn't well refuse, seeing that
amongst the ladies I was reckoned a
mild, quiet young man. Even in these
days, I must say I had a good deal of
that look, and at home they used
always to call me "quiet Ned." My
mother, good soul, never would believe
I broke windows, killed cats, or fought,
and the mystery to her always is <i>why</i>
the neighbours had a spite at me; for
if I had been a wild boy, she said, or
as noisy as little Brown next door,
why she wouldn't have objected to my
going to sea!&mdash;that noisy little Brown,
by the bye, is a fat banker. So in I
had to stick my thumbs at arms'-length,
and stoop down to the old
lady, the more with a will since I
guessed what they were talking of.
"Well though, Kate," continued the
old lady, winding away at the thread,
"you cannot deny her to be a charming
creature, my love?" "Oh, if
you mean <i>pretty</i>!" said the girl, "I
don't <i>want</i> to deny it&mdash;not <i>I</i>, ma'am!&mdash;why
should I, indeed?" "Pity
she's a little light-headed," said her
mother in a musing way. "<i>Affected</i>,
you mean, mother!" said Miss Fortescue,
"and haughty." "Do you know,
Kate," replied the old lady, sighing,
"I fear she'll soon <i>go</i> in India!"
"<i>Go?</i>" said the daughter sharply.
"Yes; she won't stand the hot season
as I did&mdash;these flighty girls never do.
Poor thing! she certainly hasn't <i>your</i>
stamina now, my love!" Here Miss Fortescue
bit her lip, tossed her head, and
was saying that wasn't what she cared
about, though in fact she looked ready
to cry; when just at the moment I saw
Lota Hyde herself half above the little
gallery stair, gazing straight at me,
for the first time, too; a curious kind
of half-smile on her face, as I stood
with my paws out, the old lady jerking
the yarn off my wrists, and I
staring right over her big bonnet at
the sky astern of the awning, pretending
not to listen. All at once my
mouth fell, and before she could turn
her face away from the funny countenance
I no doubt put on, I saw her
cheek rosy and her eyes sparkle with
laughter, instead of seeming like one to
die soon. For my part I couldn't stand
it at all, so I just bolted sheer round
and made three strides to the poop
ladder, as dignified as was possible
with ever so many plies of red yarn
foul of my wrists, and a big red ball
hopping after me when I'd vanished,
like a fellow running from a hot shot!
I daresay they thought on the poop
I'd had a stroke of the sun on my
brain; but till next day I kept clear
of the passengers, and took to swigging
off stiff nor'-westers of grog, as long
as Westwood would let me.</p>

<p>Next evening, when the cuddy dinner
was scarce over, I went up to the
poop, where there was no one to be
seen; the sun just setting on our starboard-quarter
in a golden blaze that
stretched overhead, with flakes of it
melting, as 'twere, all over the sky to
port, and dropping in it like threads of
oil in water; the ship with a light
breeze aft, and stunsails packed large
upon her, running almost due for the
Line. The waves to westward were
like liquid light, and the eddies round
our counter came glittering out, the
whole spread of her mizen and main
canvass shining like gold cloth against
the fore: then 'twas but the royals
and skysails brighter than ever, as the
big round sun dipped down with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
red streak or two, and the red waterline,
against his hot old face. Every
blue surge between had a clear green
edge about its crest, the hollows turning
themselves inside out from deep
purple into bright blue, and outside
in again,&mdash;and the whole rim of the
sea grew out cool and clear away from
the ship's taffrail. A pair of sharp-headed
dolphins that had kept alongside
for the last few minutes, swimming
near the surface, turned tail
round, the moment I put my nose
over the bulwark, and shot off like
two streaks of a rainbow after the
flying-fish. I was just wondering
where Lota Hyde could be, this time,
when on a sudden I observed little
Tommy poke his curly head out of
the booby-hatch, peeping cautiously
round; seeing nobody, however, save
the man at the wheel, who was looking
over his shoulder at the sun, the
small rogue made a bolt out of the
companion, and scampered aft under
the awning to the Judge's starboard
door, with nothing on but his nightshirt.
There he commenced kicking
and shoving with his bare feet and
arms, till the door flew open, and over
went Tommy on his nose, singing out
in fine style. The next thing I heard
was a laugh like the sound of a silver
bell; and just as the boy's sister ran
up in a fright lest he had gone overboard,
Violet Hyde came out leading
the little chap wrapped in a long shawl
that trailed astern of him, herself with
a straw bonnet barely thrown upon
her head. "Tommy says you put
him to bed too soon, Jane!" said she
smiling. "Iss!" said Master Thomas,
stoutly, "go 'way, Dzane!" "You
hadn't bid me good-night&mdash;wasn't that
it, Tom? But oh! <i>what</i> a sea!" exclaimed
she, catching sight of it under
the awning. The little fellow wanted
to see it too, so the young lady lifted
him up in her arms, no small weight
I daresay, and they both looked over
the bulwark: the whole sky far out of
the awning to westward being spotted
with orange scales, turning almost
scarlet, faster than the dusk from
both ends could close in; the clear
greenish tint of it above the openings
of the canvass, going up into fathomless
blue overhead, the horizon purple,
and one or two still, black clouds
tipped with vermilion against the far
sky&mdash;while the Indiaman stole along,
scarce plashing under her bends.
Every now and then you heard a
whizz and a flutter, as the flying-fish
broke out of a bigger surge, sometimes
just missing the ship's side: at last
two or three fell over the mizen chains,
and pop came one all of a sudden right
into the white breast of Miss Hyde's
dress inside her scarf, where only the
wings kept it from disappearing. She
started, Jane screamed, but the little
boy coolly pulled it out, commencing
to overhaul it in great delight. "Oh
fat a funny ickoo bird!" shouted he,
"it's fell down out of 'ese t'ees!"
looking aloft. "No, no," said Miss
Hyde, laughing, as she drew her
shoulders together with a shiver,
"birds' noses don't drop water!
'Twill die if you don't put it in again,
Tommy&mdash;'tis a fish!" "A fish!"
said he, opening his eyes wider, and
smacking his lips, "yes, Tommy eat
it for my beckfust!" However the
young lady took it out of his hand
and dropped it overboard; on which
the small ogre went off rather discontented,
and kissed her more as a
favour than otherwise. It was almost
dark already, the water shining up in
the ship's wake, and the stars coming
out aloft; so I was left wondering at
the impudence of flying-fish, and the
blessings of being a fat little imp in a
frock and trousers, compared with
this puzzle of a "traverse," betwixt
<i>being</i> a third lieutenant and hailing
for a "griffin."</p>

<p>The night following, after a sultry
hot day, the wind had varied a good
deal, and the ship was running almost
close-hauled on a warm south-easterly
breeze, with somewhat of a swell in
the water. Early in the first watch
there was a heavy shower, after which
I went on deck, leaving Westwood
at his book. The half-moon was just
getting down to leeward, clear of
a ragged dark cloud, and a long
space of faint white light spread
away on the horizon, behind the
sheets of the sails hauled aft; so
that you just saw a sort of a glimmer
under them, on the black heave
of the swell between. Every time
she rolled to leeward on it, a gleam of
the moonshine slipped inside the shadow
of her high bulwarks, from one
wet carronade to another, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
glistening over the moist decks, and
among the boats and booms, that
looked like some big brute or other
lying stretched out on his paws, till
you saw the men's faces on the forecastle
as if they were so many mutineers
skulking in the dark before they
rushed aft: then up she righted again,
and all was dark inboard. The awnings
were off, and the gruff third mate
creaking slowly to and fro in his soaked
shoes; the Judge stood talking
with the captain before one of the
round-house doors; directly after I
noticed a young lady's figure in a
white dress close by the mizen-rigging,
apparently intent on the sea to
leeward. "Well, now or never!"
thought I, stepping over in the shadow
of the main-sheet. I heard her draw
a long breath: and then, without
turning her head at the sound of my
foot, "I wonder if there is anything
so strange in India," exclaimed she;
"<i>is</i> there now?" "No, by&mdash;&mdash;, no,
madam!" said I, starting, and watching
as the huge cloud grew darker,
with a rusty stain in it, while three or
four broad-backed swells, one beyond
the other, rose up black against the
setting moon, as if they'd plunge right
into her. Miss Hyde turned round,
with one hand on the bulwark to steady
herself, and half looked at me. "I
thought&mdash;" said she; "where is papa?&mdash;I
thought my father&mdash;" I begged
pardon for intruding, but next minute
she appeared to have forgotten it, and
said, in a musing sort of way, partly
to herself, partly to me&mdash;"I seem to
<i>remember</i> it all&mdash;as if I just saw that
black wave&mdash;and&mdash;that monstrous
cloud&mdash;over again! Oh! really that is
the <i>very</i> same top it had <i>then</i>&mdash;see!"
"Yes," said I, leaning forward, with
a notion I <i>had</i> seen it before, though
heaven knew when. "Did you ever
read about Columbus and Vasco da
Gama?" asked she, though directly
afterwards her features broke into
a laughing smile as she caught sight
of mine&mdash;at the thought, I suppose, of
my ridiculous figure the last time she
saw me. "No, never," said I; "but
look to windward, ma'am; 'tis coming
on a squall again. For heaven's sake,
Miss Hyde, go in! We're to have another
shower, and that pretty thick.
I wonder the mate don't stow the
royals." "What do you mean?" said
she, turning. "Why are you alarmed,
sir? I see nothing particular." The
sea was coming over, in a smooth,
round-backed swell, out of a dirty,
thick jumble of a sky, with a pitchblack
line behind&mdash;what Ford would
have called "wild" by daylight; but
the young lady's eye naturally saw no
more in it than a dark night. Here
the Judge came over from the binnacle,
giving me a nod, as much as to
say he recollected me. "I am afraid,
sir," said I, "if you don't make haste,
you'll get wet." "How!" said Sir
Charles, "'tis an exceedingly pleasant
night, I think, after such a
deuced hot day. They don't know
how to cool rooms here&mdash;this perpetual
wood retains heat till midnight,
sir! That detestable pitch precludes
walking&mdash;the sea absolutely glares
like tin. <i>Why</i> do you suppose so now&mdash;eh,
young gentleman?" said he
again, turning back, all of a sudden,
with his daughter on his arm. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;why,
Sir Charles," said I, hesitating
betwixt sham innocence and
scarce knowing what reason to give;
"why, I just think&mdash;that is to say, it's
my feeling, you see." "Ah, ah, I <i>do</i>
see," replied the Judge, good-humouredly;
"but you shouldn't ape
the sailor, my good fellow, as I fancy
you do a little. I don't particularly
admire the class, but they always
have grounds for what they say in
their profession, frequently even acute.
At your aunt's, Lady Somers's, now,
Violet, who was naturally so surrounded
by naval officers, what I had
to object to was, not their want of intelligence,
but their forwardness. Eh!
eh! who&mdash;what is <i>that</i>?" exclaimed
he suddenly, looking straight up into
the dark, as five or six large drops
fell on his face out of it. All at once
you heard a long sigh, as it were, in
the canvass aloft, a clap like two or
three carronades fired off, as all the
sails together went in to the masts&mdash;then
a hum in the air far and near&mdash;and
whish! rush! came the rain in
sheets and bucketfuls off the edge of
a cloud over our very heads, plashing
and washing about the deck with coils
of rope; ship rolling without a breath
of wind in her sails; sails flapping out
and in; the rain pouring down ten
times faster than the scupper-holes
would let it out, and smoking gray in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the dark hollow of the swells, that
sank under the force of it. The first
officer came on deck, roaring in the
hubbub to clue up and furl the royals
before the wind came again. It got
pitch-dark, you couldn't see your hand
before you, and we had all lost mark
of each other, as the men came shoving
in between us. However I knew
whereabouts Miss Hyde was, so I felt
along the larboard rigging till I found a
backstay clasped in her hands, and the
soaked sleeve of her muslin dress,
while she leant back on a carronade,
to keep from being jerked down in the
water that washed up over her feet
with every roll, full of ropes and a
capstan-bar or two. Without saying
a word, I took up Lota in my arms, and
carried her aft in spite of the roll and
confusion, steering for the glimmer of
the binnacle, till I got her inside one
of their own cabins, where there was
a lamp swinging about, and laid her
on a sofa. I felt somehow or other,
as I went, that the sweet creature
hadn't fainted, though all the while as
still as death; accordingly I made
off again at once to find the
Judge, who, no doubt, was calling
for his daughter, with a poor
chance of being heard. In a minute
or two more the rain was over; it
was light enough to make out the
horizon, as the belt of foam came
broadening out of it; the ship gave
two or three wild bounds, the wheel
jolting and creaking: up swelled the
black waves again over one side, the
topsails flapped full as the squall
rushed roaring into them, and away
she rose; then tore into it like a
scared horse, shaking her head and
throwing the snow-white foam into
her forechains. 'Twas as much as
three men could do to grind down
her wheel, leaning and grinning to it;
you saw just the Indiaman herself,
scarce so far forward as the booms,
and the broad swell mounting with
her out of the dark, as she slowly
squared yards before it, taking in
to'gallant-sails while she did so, with
her topsail-yards lowered on the caps.
However, the look of it was worse than
its force, else the swell wouldn't have
risen so fast, as every sailor knew; and
by two bells of the mid-watch she was
bowling under all, as easy as before, the
mate of the watch setting a stunsail.</p>

<p>When I went down, shaking myself
like a Newfoundland, Westwood was
swinging in his cot with a book turned
to the lamp, reading <i>Don Quixote</i> in
Spanish. "Bless me, Ned!" said he,
"you seem to like it! paying fair and
weathering it too!" "Only a little
adventure, Westwood!" said I, laughing.
"Why, here have I been enjoying
better adventures than we seem
likely to have," said he, "without
stirring a hand, except for the wild
swings you gave me from deck.
Here's <i>Don Quixote</i>&mdash;" "Don Quixote
be hanged!" said I: "I'd rather wear
ship in a gale, myself, than all the
humbug that never happened&mdash;<i>out</i> of
an infernal play-book. What's the use
of <i>thinking</i> you see service, when you
don't? After all, you couldn't <i>expect</i>
much till we've crossed the Line&mdash;nothing
like the tropics, or the Cape,
for thickening a plot, Tom. Then
there's the Mozambique, you know!"
"Well, we'll see," said Westwood,
lazily, and half asleep.</p>

<p>The whole next day would have
been weary enough in itself, as not a
single glimpse of the fair Lota could
I catch; and the weather, between
the little puffs of air and squalls we
had, was fit to have melted poor Ford
to the bone, but for the rain. However,
that day was sufficient, by fits
and starts, to bring us up to the Line;
and, before crossing it, which we did
by six o'clock in one of the black
squalls, half of the passengers had
been pretty well ducked by Neptune
and his gang, besides. Rare fun we
had of it for three or four hours on
end; the cadets and writers showing
fight in a body, the Yankee being
regularly keelhauled, tarred, and
feathered, though I believe he had
crossed the Line twice by land; while
the Scotch surgeon was found out, in
spite of his caution, never to have been
lower than the West Indies&mdash;so he got
double ration. A word to Jacobs
took Westwood Scot-free; but, for
my own part, wishing of course to
blind the officers, I let the men stick
the tar-brush in my mouth the first
word I spoke, and was shaved like
the mischief, not to speak of plumping
afterwards behind the studding-sail
curtain into three feet of water, where I
absolutely saved Ford from drowning,
he being as sick as a dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Late at night, the breeze held and
freshened; and, being Saturday night,
the gentlemen in the cuddy kept it
uproariously after their troubles,
drinking and singing songs, Tom
Little's and your sentimental affairs;
till, being a bit flushed myself, I was
on the point of giving them one of
Dibdin's, when I thought better of
it, and went on deck instead. The
mate was there, however, and his
red-whiskered Scotch sub with the
twisted snout, leaning on the capstan
with their noses together. The night
was dark, and the ship made a good
noise through the water; so "hang
it!" thought I, "somehow or other
I'll have out a stave of 'Black-eyed
Susan' at the top of my pipe, though
overboard I go for it!" There was
an old spare topsail-yard slung alongside
to larboard, as far as the quarter-boat,
and I went up to the poop to
get over and sit on it; especially
when I found Ford's friend, the fat
midshipman, was in the boat itself,
"caulking"<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> his watch out, as he
did every night in a fresh place. I
was no sooner there, again, than I
saw a light in the aftermost gallery
window, and took it in my head if I
sung <i>there</i>, why, in place of being
afraid there was some one under her
casement, that and the wind and
water together would put her to sleep,
if she was the worse of last night&mdash;in
fact I may say I was a little
"<i>slewed</i>"<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> at the time. How to
get there, though, was the matter, it
being rather nice practice to sling
over an Indiaman's quarter-gallery,
bulging out from her steep counter:
accordingly, first I took the end of a
coil round the mizen-shrouds, and
made a bowline-knot to creep down
the stern-mouldings with, and then
swing free by help of a guide-line to
boot. Just before letting go of the
taffrail, another fancy struck me, to
hitch the guide-line to the trigger of
the life-buoy that hung ready for use;
not that I'd the notion of saving myself
if I went overboard, but just
because of the good joke of a fellow
slipping his own life-buoy, and
then cruising away with a light at
his masthead back to the Line. 'Twas
curious&mdash;but when I was "two or
three cloths in the wind," far from
growing stupid, I used always to get
a sort of cunning that would have
made me try and cheat a purser; so
away I lowered myself till the rope
was taut, when I slipped easy enough
round the counter, below the window.
Every time she rolled, out I swung,
and in again, till I steadied with my
feet, slacking off the other line from
one hand. Then I began to give voice
like old Boreas himself, with a sort of
a notion, at each shove I got, how I
was rocking the Indiaman like a big
cradle, as Jacobs did his baby. All
at once, I felt the rope was <i>giving</i> off
the belaying-pin, till I came down
with a jolt under the window below;
only singing the louder, as it was half
open, and I could just look in. With
every wash of the waves, the water,
a couple of fathoms under my feet,
blazed up like fire, and the wake ran
boiling out from the black stern by
the rudder, like the iron out of a furnace:
now and then there came a
sulky flare of dumb lightning to leeward,
and showed the black swell out
of the dark for miles. I fancied I
didn't care for the water, but I began
to think 'twas rather uncomfortable
the notion of sousing into such an infernally
flame-looking stream: I was
actually in a fright at being boiled,
and not able to swim. So I dropped
chorus to haul myself up; when of a
sudden, by the lamp inside the state-room,
I saw Winterton and Ford come
reeling in, one after the other, as
drunk as lords. Winterton swayed
about quietly on his legs for a minute,
and then looked gravely at Ford, as
if he'd got a dreadful secret to make
known. "Ford!" said he. "Ay,"
said Ford, feeling to haul off his
trousers,&mdash;"ay&mdash;avast you&mdash;blub-lub-lubber!"
"I say, Ford!" said the
cadet again, in a melancholy way, fit
to melt a marlinspike, and then fell
to cry&mdash;Ford all the time pulling off
his trousers, with a cigar in his mouth,
till he got on a chest, and contrived
to flounder into his cot with his coat
on. After that he stretched over to
put the lamp out, carefully enough;
but he let fall his cigar, and one leg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>of his nankeen trousers hung out of
the cot, just scraping the deck every
time he swung. I watched, accordingly,
holding on by the sill, till I
saw a spark catch in the stuff&mdash;and
there it was, swinging slowly away
in the dark, with a fiery ring creeping
round the leg of the trousers, ready
to blow into a flame as soon as it had
a clear swing. No doubt the fool
would come down safe enough himself
with his cot; but I knew Winterton
kept powder in the cabin sufficient
to blow up the deck above, where
that sweet girl was sleeping at the
moment. "Confound it!" I thought,
quite cooled by the sight, "the sooner
I get on deck the better!" However,
you may fancy my thoughts when I
heard men at the taffrail, hauling on
the spanker-boom guys, so I held on
till they'd go forward again: suddenly
the mate's voice sung out to know
"what lubber had belayed the slack
of a topsail-clueline <i>here</i>?" Down I
went with the word, as the rope was
thrown off, with just time to save
myself by a clutch of the portsill at
arm's-length&mdash;where, heaven knew, I
couldn't keep long. The mate looked
over and caught sight of my face, by
a flicker of the summer lightning, as
I was slipping down: I gave him one
curse as loud as I could hail, and let
go the moulding&mdash;"Man overboard!"
shouted he, and the men after him:
however I wasn't altogether overboard
yet, for I felt the other part of
the rope bring me up with a jerk and
a swing right under the quarter-boat,
where I clung like a cat. How to
get on deck again, without being seen,
was the question, and anxious enough
I was at thought of the burning train
inside; when out jumped some one
over my head: I heard a splash in the
water, and saw a fellow's face go
sinking into the bright wake astern,
while the boat itself was coming down
over me from the davits. I still had
the guide-line from the life-buoy round
my wrist, and one moment's thought
was enough to make me give it a
furious tug, when away I sprang clear
into the eddies. The first thing I
saw at coming up was the ships'
lighted stern-windows driving to leeward,
then the life-buoy flaring and
dipping on a swell, and a bare head,
with two hands, sinking a few feet off.
I made for him at once, and held him
up by the hair as I struck out for the
buoy. A couple of minutes after, the
men in the boat had hold of us and
it; the ship came sheering round to
the wind, and we were very shortly
aboard again. "Confound it, Simm,
what took you overboard, man?"
asked the mid in the boat at his dripping
messmate, the fat reefer. "Oh,
bother!" said he, "if you must know&mdash;why,
I mistook the quarter-boats;
I thought 'twas the <i>other</i> I was in,
when you kicked up that shindy!
Now I remember, though, there was
too much <i>rain</i> in it for comfort!"
"Well, youngster," said Tom, the
man-o'-war'sman, "this here gentleman
saved your life, anyhow!"
"Why, mate," whispered Bill, "'tis
the wery same greenhorn we puckalowed
so to-day! Didn't he jump
sharp over, too?" "Pull! for your
lives, my lads!" said I, looking up at
Ford's window; and the moment we
got on deck, below I ran into the
state-room, and cut Ford down by
the heels, with the tinder hanging
from him, and one leg of his trousers
half gone. As for the poor reefer, a
pretty blowing-up he got; the men
swore I had jumped overboard after
him, and the mate would have it that,
instead of sleeping, he wanted to get
into the Judge's cabins; especially
when next day Sir Charles was in a
rage at his daughter being disturbed by
some sailor or other singing outside.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INSURRECTION_IN_BADEN" id="THE_INSURRECTION_IN_BADEN">THE INSURRECTION IN BADEN.</a></h2>

<p>(TO THE EDITOR OF BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I chanced to be at Heidelberg
at the outbreak of the late revolutionary
movement, and remained
there, or in the neighbourhood, during
its entire duration. It occurs to me
that a brief narrative of the leading
events of that period of confusion and
anarchy, from the pen of one who was
not only an eyewitness of all that
passed, but who, from long residence
in this part of Germany, has a pretty
intimate acquaintance with the real
condition and feelings of the people,
may prove suitable to the pages, and
not uninteresting to the readers, of
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>At a public meeting held at Offenburg,
in the duchy of Baden, on the 13th
of May 1849, and which was attended
by many of the most violent members
of the German republican party, it
was resolved that the constitution
voted by the national assembly at
Frankfort should be acknowledged;
that Brentano and Peter should be
charged with the formation of a new
ministry; that Struve, and all other
political offenders, should be forthwith
set at liberty; that the selection of
officers for the army should be left to
the choice of the privates; and lastly,
that the movement in the Palatinate
(Rhenish Bavaria) should be fully
supported by the government of
Baden.</p>

<p>For the information of those who
have not closely followed the late
course of events in Germany, it may
be necessary to mention, that early in
the month of May a revolutionary
movement, the avowed object of which
was to force the King to acknowledge
the constitution drawn up by the parliament
at Frankfort, had broken out
in Rhenish Bavaria. A provisional
government had been formed, the
public money seized, forced contributions
levied, and the entire Palatinate
declared independent of Bavaria. The
leaders of the insurrection had been
joined by a portion of discontented
military; and, in an incredibly short
space of time, the whole province,
with the exception of the fortresses of
Germersheim and Landau, had fallen
into their hands.</p>

<p>Although the declared motive of
the Offenburg assembly was to support
this movement, and thus oblige the
reigning princes to bow to the decrees
of the central parliament, there is
little doubt that a long-formed and
widely-extended conspiracy existed,
the object of which was to proclaim a
republic throughout Germany. The
meeting in question was attended by
upwards of twenty thousand persons,
many of whom were soldiers, seduced
by promises of increased pay, and of
the future right to elect their officers.
Money was plentifully distributed;
and towards evening the mob, mad
with drink and excitement, returned,
howling revolutionary songs, to their
homes. At the very time this was
going on, a mutiny in the garrison of
Rastadt had placed that fortress
in the power of about four thousand
soldiers, many of them raw recruits.
This extraordinary event, apparently
the result of a drunken quarrel, was
shrewdly suspected to be part of a
deep-laid scheme for supporting the
movement, which was expected to
follow the next day's meeting at
Offenburg. If such were the hopes of
the leaders, they were not disappointed;
the train was laid, and wanted
but a spark to fire it. The result of
the Offenburg meeting was known at
Carlsruhe by six o'clock in the evening
of the day of its occurrence; and
on the same evening, some riotous
soldiers having been placed in confinement,
their comrades insisted on their
release. In vain did the officers,
headed by Prince Frederick, (the
Grand-duke's second son,) endeavour
to appease them; they were grossly
insulted, and the prince received a
sabre cut on the head. It is thought
by many persons that if, at this time,
energetic measures had been taken,
the whole movement might have been
crushed.</p>

<p>But with citizens timid or lukewarm,
and soldiers the greater number
of whom were in open mutiny, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
is difficult to say where the repressive
power was to have been found. Be
this as it may, the barracks were demolished,
the stores broken open and
robbed; and by eleven o'clock that
night the ducal family, and as many
of the ministers and attendants as
could find the means of evasion, were
in full flight. With arms supplied by
the plunder of the barracks, the mob
next attacked the arsenal, which was
under the protection of the national
guard. A squadron of dragoons who
came to assist the latter were fired
on by both parties, and the captain, a
promising young officer, was killed on
the spot. The dragoons, seeing their
efforts to support the citizens thus
misinterpreted, retired, and left the
arsenal to its fate.</p>

<p>Early next morning, a provisional
government, headed by Brentano and
Fickler, was proclaimed, to which all
people were summoned to swear obedience;
and, absurdly enough, the
very men, soldiers and citizens, who
the day before had, with the acquiescence
of the duke, taken an oath
of allegiance to the empire, now swore
to be faithful to the new order of
things. The news of the outbreak
spread like wildfire. It was received
with particular exultation in the towns
of Mannheim and Heidelberg; in the
latter of which a very republican
spirit prevailed, and where, at the
first call, the national guard assembled,
eager to display their valour&mdash;in
words. It was not long before their
mettle was put to the proof. The
Duke, who had taken refuge in the
fortress of Germersheim, had been
escorted in his flight by about three
hundred dragoons, with sixteen pieces
of artillery. These brave fellows, who
had remained faithful to their sovereign,
attempted, after leaving him in
safety, to make their way to Frankfort.
As every inch of the country
they had to traverse was in open revolt,
the circumstance was soon known
at Heidelberg, where, late in the
evening, the tocsin rang, to summon
the peasants from the neighbouring
villages, and the <i>g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> beat through
the streets to call the citizens to arms,
in order that parties might be sent
out to intercept the soldiers. It would
be difficult to describe the panic that
prevailed in Heidelberg at the first
sound of this terrible drum. The
most ridiculous and contradictory reports
were circulated. That some
great danger was at hand, all agreed;
and the story generally credited
was, that the peasants of the Odenwald
were coming down, ten thousand
strong, to plunder the town. When
the real cause of the disturbance was
discovered, it may be doubted whether,
to many, the case appeared much
mended; for, besides the disinclination
a set of peaceable tradesmen might
feel to attack a body of dragoons,
backed by sixteen pieces of artillery,
many of those who were summoned
from their beds were secretly opposed
to the cause they were called upon to
serve. But there was no remedy;
and, amidst the tears and shrieks of
women, the ringing of bells, and beating
of drums, the first detachment
marched off. No sooner did they arrive
at the supposed scene of action,
than, seized with a sudden panic,
caused by a row of trees which, in
the dark, they mistook for the enemy
in battle array, they faced about, and
fairly ran for it till they found themselves
once more in Heidelberg.</p>

<p>The consequences were more serious
to some of the members of a second
party, despatched to Ladenburg. In
the middle of the night, the sentry
posted on the bridge mistook the trotting
of some stray donkey for a charge
of dragoons, and firing his rifle, without
farther deliberation he threw himself
over the bridge, breaking a thigh
and a couple of ribs in the fall. The
others stood their ground; but it is
well known that several of the party
were laid up next day with <i>nerven feber</i>,
(a sort of low typhus,) brought on by
the fear and agitation they had undergone.</p>

<p>These facts are merely mentioned
to show that, had the government, at
the commencement of the outbreak,
made the slightest show of firmness,
they would not have met with the resistance
which they afterwards found.</p>

<p>The dragoons, after dodging about
for two days and nights, worn out
with fatigue and hunger, at length
allowed themselves to be captured
near the frontiers of W&uuml;rtemberg.
It seems that the soldiers positively
refused to make use of their arms after
the Duke's flight, which, indeed, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the only way of accounting for three
hundred mounted dragoons, with sixteen
pieces of artillery fully supplied
with ammunition, falling into the
hands of as many peasants, who would
undoubtedly have fled at the first shot
fired.</p>

<p>Whilst these events passed, the
reins of government at Carlsruhe had
been seized by Brentano, Peter, Fickler,
and Goegg&mdash;the latter a convicted
felon. Struve and Blind, condemned
to eight years' imprisonment for their
rebellion the year before, were released,
and, with their friends, took a
prominent part in the formation of the
new ministry. The war department
was given to a Lieutenant Eichfeld,
who, by the way, had some time previously
quitted the service, on account
of a duel in which he displayed the
white feather. His first measure was
to order the whole body of soldiers,
now entirely deprived of their officers,
to select others from the ranks. The
choice was just what might have been
expected; and instances occurred in
which recruits of three weeks' standing
passed at once to the rank of
captain and major. All discipline
was soon at an end. The army, consisting
of 17,000 men, was placed
under the command of Lieutenant
Sigel, a young man of twenty-two,
whose sole claims to preferment seem
to have been, that he was compromised
in Struve's abortive attempt at
Friburg, and had since contributed a
number of articles, violently abusive of
the government, to some low revolutionary
newspapers. Headquarters
were established at Heidelberg, where
Sigel, accompanied by Eichfeld, arrived
on the 19th of May.</p>

<p>The pecuniary affairs of the insurgents
were in the most flourishing
condition. Seven millions of florins
(about &pound;560,000) were found in the
war-chest, besides two and a half
millions of paper-money, and large
sums belonging to other departments of
the ministry. Their stock of arms consisted
of seventy thousand muskets,
without reckoning those of the national
guard and military. Thus equipped and
supplied, they would have been able,
with a little drill, and if properly
commanded, to make a long stand
against the regular forces sent against
them. By this time, too, the country
was fast filling with political refugees
of all shades of opinion. Italians,
Swiss, Poles, and French were daily
pouring in; and the well-known Metternich,
of Mayence celebrity, who
had not been heard of since his flight
from the barricades at Frankfort,
again turned up as commander of a
free corps. A sketch of his costume
will give a pretty fair idea of that
adopted by all those who wished to
distinguish themselves as ultra-liberals.
He wore a white broad-brimmed
felt hat, turned up on one side, with a
large red feather; a blue <i>kittel</i> or
smock-frock; a long cavalry sabre
swung from his belt, in which were
stuck a pair of ponderous horse pistols;
troopers' boots, reaching to the middle
of the thigh, were garnished with
enormous spurs, and across his breast
flamed a crimson scarf, the badge of
the red republican.</p>

<p>In order to extend the revolt, and
to place Baden in a state of defence
before the governments should recover
from their panic, the most energetic
measures were taken. A decree was
issued for arming the whole male
population, from eighteen to thirty
years of age; and as in many instances
the peasantry proved refractory, a tax
of fifty florins per day was laid on all
recusants, who, when discovered, were
taken by force to join the army.
Raveaux, Trutschler, Erbe, and
Fr&ouml;bel, the latter that friend of
Robert Blum, who so narrowly
escaped the cord when his companion
was shot,&mdash;made their appearance at
Carlsruhe. They issued a violent
proclamation against the King of
Prussia, and, the better to disguise
their real object, called on all Germany
to arm in defence of the parliament at
Frankfort, and the provisional government
of Baden. Every artifice, no
matter how disreputable, that could
serve the cause, was unscrupulously
resorted to. It was officially announced
that W&uuml;rtemberg and Hesse-Darmstadt
were only waiting a
favourable opportunity to join the
movement; and to further this object,
a public meeting (which it was hoped
would bring forth the same fruits at
Darmstadt, as that of Offenburg had
produced at Carlsruhe) was called by
the radicals of the Odenwald. It
took place at Laudenbach, a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
situated about three miles within
the Hessian frontier, and was attended
by upwards of six thousand
armed peasants, and by three or
four thousand of the Baden free
corps. The authorities were, however,
on the alert; and after a
fruitless summons to the insurgents
to quit the territory, the military were
called out. Before orders to fire were
given, the civil commissary, desirous
to avoid effusion of blood, advanced
alone towards the crowd, endeavouring
to persuade them to retire peaceably.
He was barbarously murdered;
and the sight of his dead body so
incensed the Hessian soldiers, that
they rushed forward without waiting
for the word of command, and with
one volley put the whole mob of insurgents
to flight.</p>

<p>The spirit displayed on this occasion
probably saved the country from
a bloody civil war; for had the revolutionary
movement passed the frontiers
of Baden, at that moment the flame
would doubtless have spread to W&uuml;rtemberg,
and thence not improbably
to the whole of Germany, with the
exception perhaps of Prussia.</p>

<p>To counteract the very unsatisfactory
effect of the meeting at Laudenbach,
it was resolved, by a council
held at Carlsruhe, that a bold stroke
should be struck. The Hessians,
hitherto unsupported by other troops,
could not command anything like the
numerical force of Baden, and Sigel
received orders to cross the frontier
with all his disposable troops. Four
battalions of the line, with about six
thousand volunteers, were reviewed at
Heidelberg before taking the field.
They were indeed a motley crew! The
soldiers, who had helped themselves
from the stores at Carlsruhe to whatever
best suited their fancy, appeared
on parade equipped accordingly. Shakos,
helmets, caps, greatcoats, frocks,
full-dress and undress uniforms, all
figured in the same ranks. The so-called
officers, in particular, cut a
pitiful figure. If the smart uniform
and epaulette could have disguised
the clownish recruit, who had perhaps
figured but a few weeks in the ranks,
the license of his conduct would soon
have betrayed him; for officers and
privates, arm in arm, and excessively
drunk, might constantly be seen reeling
through the streets. The free
corps, unwilling to be outdone by the
regulars, indulged in all sorts of
theatrical dresses, yellow and red
boots being in great favour; whilst
one fellow, claiming no lower rank
than that of colonel, actually rode
about in a blouse and white cotton
drawers, with Hessian boots and
large gold tassels.</p>

<p>As it was strongly suspected that
the soldiers placed little confidence in
their new leaders, and the free corps,
many of whom were serving against
their own wishes, seemed equally
unwilling to risk their lives under
such commanders as Metternich and
B&ouml;nin, (a watchmaker from Wiesbaden,)
all sorts of artifices were
resorted to, to encourage both regulars
and irregulars. Their whole force
might amount to thirty thousand
men; but, by marches and countermarches,
similar to those by which,
in a theatre, a few dozen of soldiers
are made to represent thousands, they
so dazzled the eyes of the ignorant,
that it was believed their army
numbered nearly a hundred thousand
men. The cavalry, in particular,
which were quartered in Heidelberg,
were marched out and in again
five times in as many days&mdash;at each
appearance being hailed as a fresh
regiment. Soothsayers and prophets
were also consulted, and interpreted
divers passages in holy writ as foretelling
the defeat of the Prussians, and
the success of the "Army of Freedom."
But the trick which, no doubt,
had the greatest influence on the
minds of the poor duped people was a
forged declaration, purporting to be
one put forth by the Hessian troops,
professing their intention of throwing
down their arms on the approach of
their "German brothers."</p>

<p>On the 28th of May, the insurgents,
ten thousand in number, crossed
the frontier of Hesse-Darmstadt. The
Hessians, with three battalions of
infantry, a couple of six-pounders,
and a squadron of light cavalry,
waited their approach; and having
withdrawn their outposts, (a movement
interpreted into a flight by the
opposite party,) they suddenly opened
a severe fire on the advancing columns&mdash;driving
them back to Weinheim,
with a loss of upwards of fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
killed and wounded. The affair commenced
at four o'clock in the afternoon,
and by ten at night the whole
insurgent force arrived pell-mell at
Heidelberg. Officers and dragoons
led the van, followed by artillery,
infantry, baggage-waggons, and free
corps, mingled together in the utmost
disorder. They had run from Weinheim,
a distance of twelve miles, in
three hours&mdash;driven by their fears
only; for the Hessians, too weak
to take advantage of their victory,
and content with driving them from
their own territory, waited for reinforcements
before attempting farther
hostilities.</p>

<p>This check was a sad damper to the
ardour of the insurgents. It was necessary
to find some one on whom to fix
the blame; and as the dragoons were
known to be unfavourable to the new
order of things, the official account of
the affair stated that the enemy would
have been thoroughly beaten, had the
cavalry charged when ordered so to do.</p>

<p>This was the only action fought
under Sigel's generalship&mdash;as a specimen
of which it may be mentioned
that the <i>band</i> of the Guards was sent
into action at the head of the regiment,
and lost five men by the first
volley fired. Whatever the reason,
Sigel was removed from his functions
next day, and Eichfeld, disgusted
with such an opening to the campaign,
changed his place of minister
of war for a colonelcy in the Guards;
and, pocketing a month's pay, took
himself quietly off, and has never
been heard of since.</p>

<p>As it was now evident there could
be no hopes of the Hessians joining
the movement, the tactics were
changed, and the most violent abuse
was lavished on them by the organs
of the provisional government. The
vilest calumnies were resorted to, to
exasperate the Baden troops against
them, such as that they tortured and
massacred their prisoners, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sigel had succeeded Eichfeld as minister
of war; and as it was tolerably
clear that they possessed no general
fit to lead their army to the field,
Meiroslawski was invited to take the
command. A large sum of money
was sent to him in Paris, and, while
waiting his arrival, it was determined
to act strictly on the defensive. With
this object the whole line of the
Neckar, from Mannheim to Eberbach
and Mosbach, was strongly fortified;
and the regular troops were withdrawn
from Rastadt, and concentrated on
the Hessian frontier.</p>

<p>At length the Polish adventurer,
whose arrival had been so impatiently
expected, made his appearance at
Heidelberg. Meiroslawski, a native
of the grand-duchy of Posen, began
his career as a cadet in the Prussian
service. In the Polish revolution of
1832 he played an active part, and
was deeply implicated in the plot
concocted at Cracow in 1846, which
brought such dreadful calamities on
the unfortunate inhabitants of Gallicia.
For the second time he took
refuge in France, and only returned
to his native country to join the outbreak
at Posen in 1848. There he contrived
to get himself into a Prussian
prison, from which, however, he was
after a time released. He next led
the ranks of the Sicilian insurgents;
and on the submission of the island
to the Neapolitan troops, had scarcely
time to gain his old asylum, France,
before he was called on to aid the
revolutionists of Baden. He is a
man of about forty years of age, of
middle height, slightly built, and, so
long as he is on foot, of military carriage
and appearance; but seen on
horseback, riding like a postilion
rather than a soldier, the effect is not
so good. His eyes are large and expressive,
his nose aquiline, and the
lower part of his face covered with a
large sandy beard, which descends to
the middle of his breast. Sixty of
the Duke's horses, left in the stables
at Carlsruhe, were sent to mount him
and his aides-de-camp. Poles, Swiss,
desperadoes of every description, received
commissions, and were attached
to the staff, the members of which,
when assembled, were not unlike a
group of masqueraders. Accidents,
such as stumbling over their own
sabres or their comrades' spurs, were
of common occurrence. Sometimes a
horse and his rider would be seen rolling
over together; for, excepting one
gentleman, whose rank I could not
learn, but who had figured as rider at
an equestrian circus that had attended
the fair, none of the party looked as if
they had ever mounted a horse before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The first step taken by the government,
after Meiroslawski's arrival,
was to make a formal treaty of alliance
with the provisional government
of Rhenish Bavaria, in pursuance
of one of whose provisions a plentiful
supply of artillery was sent from the
fortress of Rastadt, to furnish the
army in that part of the country.
That the two governments were in
constant communication with Ledru
Rollin and his friends, is now an
authenticated fact, as well as that
their chief hopes of success were built
on the assistance they expected to receive
from Paris. So confidently did
they anticipate the overthrow, by the
Montagne party, of the present order
of things in France, that on the very
morning the attempt took place in
Paris, placards were posted up in
Carlsruhe, Mannheim, and Heidelberg,
announcing that the citadel of Strasburg
was in the hands of the democrats,
who were hastening with
a hundred thousand men to the assistance
of their friends in Baden.</p>

<p>Until the arrival of Meiroslawski,
Brentano had refused to put in execution
the rigorous measures urged on
him by Struve and his party; but
things were now conducted differently.
Numbers of persons were cast into
prison without any formal accusation.
One clergyman in particular, thrown
into a miserable dungeon, and kept
for weeks in solitary confinement,
entirely lost his senses, and, on the
arrival of his liberators, the Prussians,
had to be taken to a lunatic asylum,
where he still remains. The whole
country was declared to be under
martial law, and notice was given
that anybody expressing dissatisfaction
with the government would be
severely punished. No person whom
the malice or ignorance of the mob
might choose to consider a spy was
safe: many of the principal shops in
the towns were closed, the proprietors
having sent off or concealed their
goods, and fled the country. Persons
known to be inimical to the government
were punished for their opinions
by contributions being levied on their
property, or soldiers billeted in their
houses. Count Obendorf, who has a
chateau in the vicinity of Heidelberg,
had no less than seven hundred and
twenty men quartered on him at one
time. Complaint was unavailing;
tyranny and terrorism reigned
throughout the land.</p>

<p>In order to give the semblance of
legality to their proceedings, the elections
for a new chamber commenced.
It will readily be imagined that none
but the friends of those in power presented
themselves as candidates: the
deputies were therefore, without exception,
the intimates or supporters
of Brentano &amp; Co. The first act of
the new assembly was to dissolve the
<i>Landes-auschuss</i>, or provisional government,
as being too numerous a
body to act with the required vigour;
and a dictatorial triumvirate, composed
of Brentano, Peter, and Goegg, was
appointed in its stead.</p>

<p>By this time serious dissensions had
broken out among the leading members
of the democratic party. Brentano
had quarrelled with Struve, who
was resolved on nothing less than the
proclamation of the red republic.
Finding his friends at Carlsruhe opposed
to this attempt, he called a
public meeting at Mannheim. Here
again his efforts were unsuccessful,
the soldiers especially being opposed
to his doctrines. As the W&uuml;rtemberg
deputies had always figured among
the most violent of the left, or republican
party, at Frankfort, and late events
had given rise to the idea that the
people of that country were disposed
to support the movement in Baden,
Fickler was sent to Stuttgart, with a
considerable sum of money to corrupt
the soldiers; and in full expectation of
the success of his mission, billets were
made out for three thousand men, who,
it was stated, were to arrive in the
evening at Heidelberg. Disappointment
ensued. The W&uuml;rtembergers,
satisfied with having forced from their
king a promise to accept the constitution
in support of which the Badeners
professed to be fighting, were not inclined
to bring further trouble and
confusion into their country, and
Fickler was thrown into prison. This
untoward event, had the Baden revolution
lasted much longer, was to have
produced a terrible war between the
two countries. The W&uuml;rtemberg
minister, however, laughed at the
insurgent government's absurd and
impotent threats, and Fickler still
remains in confinement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The first week after Meiroslawski's
arrival was taken up with preparations
for opening the campaign on a grand
scale. Upwards of fifty thousand men
were collected on the Hessian frontiers,
from which side it was expected that
the enemy would make their attack.
At the same time, the Hessians having
been reinforced by troops from
Mecklenburg, Nassau, Hesse-Cassel,
and Prussia, prepared to take the field
in earnest. Whilst the first division
of the army, under the command of
the Prince of Prussia and General
Hirschfeld, entered the Palatinate between
Kreutznach and Saarbrucken,
and advanced to the relief of Germersheim
and Landau; Meiroslawski was
held in check by continual feints, made
along the whole line of the Neckar.
On the 15th of June, a battalion of
Mecklenburgers, with a squadron of
Hessian light cavalry, and a couple of
guns, advanced from Weinheim as far
as Ladenburg. The village was taken
at the point of the bayonet; but, ignorant
of the immense force of the insurgents,
or perhaps from undervaluing
their courage, the troops allowed
themselves to be almost surrounded
by the enemy. With great difficulty
they succeeded in regaining their old
position; while the major who commanded
the party, and ten privates,
were left in the hands of the rebels.
The loss on both sides was considerable,
but was in some degree compensated
to the Imperial troops, by two
companies of the Baden Guards passing
over to them. This slight success was
boasted of by Meiroslawski as a splendid
victory, in the following bulletin:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Heidelberg</span>,<br />
<i>16th June 1849</i>.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our operations against the advancing
enemy have been crowned with success.
Yesterday, our brave army was simultaneously
attacked on all sides.</p>

<p>"In Rhenish Bavaria the Prussians were
driven back with great loss. At Ladenburg,
Colonel Sigel engaged the enemy,
who had advanced in front; while a column,
under the command of the valiant Oborski,
attacked them in rear. The enemy was
defeated on all points, and driven back in
the greatest confusion.</p>

<p>"It is only to be regretted that want
of cavalry prevented our following and
completely annihilating them.</p>

<p>"Many prisoners were made, and their
loss in arms, ammunition, and baggage,
all of which fell into our hands, was considerable.</p>

<p>"Inhabitants of Heidelberg, fear nothing
for the future. Continue to provide
the intrepid army under my command
with necessaries for continuing the
campaign so gloriously commenced, and I
will answer for the result. Strict obedience
to my orders is all I require from
you, to prevent the enemy from overrunning
the country.</p>

<p>"In commemoration of the victory of
yesterday, so gloriously obtained, the
town of Heidelberg will be illuminated.
The lights will be left burning till daybreak,
and the beer-houses will remain
open the whole night.</p></blockquote>

<p>
"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Louis Meiroslawski</span>,<br />
General-in-Chief of the Army."<br />
</p>

<p>This bombastic effusion was followed
by several others equally false and
ridiculous. The Prussians had advanced
as far as Ludwigshafen, opposite
Mannheim, without encountering any
serious resistance. The insurgent army
in the Pfalz, numbering about twelve
thousand men, under the command
of the Polish General Sznayda, had
abandoned their intrenchments almost
without striking a blow, and, with the
provisional government, fled to Knielingen,
from whence they crossed the
Rhine into Baden. The only serious
impediment encountered by the Prussians
was at Ludwigshafen, which
suffered immense damage from the
heavy and constant bombardment kept
up from batteries erected at the opposite
town of Mannheim. The railway
station was burned to the ground, and
the value of property destroyed in the
store-houses alone has been calculated
at two millions of florins, (&pound;170,000.)
On the 17th, Landau and Germersheim
were relieved; and the Prince of
Prussia, with his whole force concentrated
before the latter fortress, prepared
to cross the Rhine under the
protection of its guns.</p>

<p>Having thus fully accomplished the
first part of his arduous undertaking,
by re-establishing order in the Pfalz,
the Prince of Prussia prepared to effect
a junction with the second and
third divisions of the army, under the
command of General Von Gr&ouml;ben, and
Peucker, the former of whom had
again advanced to Ladenburg, on the
right bank of the Neckar. Meiroslawski,
in the mean time, remained totally
inactive from the 15th to the 20th inst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Upwards of fifty thousand men had
been reviewed by him in Heidelberg
and its vicinity; besides this, the twelve
thousand Bavarian insurgents, under
the command of Sznayda, were in the
neighbourhood of Bruchsal; and with
such a force, anything like a determined
resistance would have compelled
the Prussians to purchase victory
by a heavy loss. Whatever may be
his reputation for talent, Meiroslawski
showed but little skill as a general
during his short command in Baden.
Instead of opposing the crossing of the
Rhine by the Prussians, which, with so
large a force, and fifty-four pieces of
well-served artillery, he might easily
have done, the Prince of Prussia, with
a division of fifteen thousand men, was
allowed to obtain a secure footing in
his rear, almost unopposed.</p>

<p>From this moment the position of
the insurgents became critical in the
extreme. The line of the Neckar was
occupied on the right bank by the
second and third divisions of the army,
comprising upwards of thirty thousand
men. Although hitherto held in check
by the strong intrenchments that had
been thrown up, they might still advance
in front; whilst the high road
to Rastadt was effectually cut off by
the Prince of Prussia, whose headquarters
were now at Phillipsburg.</p>

<p>The Rhine had been crossed by the
Prussians on the 20th, and on the
evening of that day Meiroslawski, for
the first time, showed a disposition to
move from his comfortable quarters
at the Prince Carl hotel in Heidelberg.
Collecting all his force, (with the exception
of three or four thousand men,
who were left in the intrenchments
before Ladenburg and on the line of
the Neckar,) he left Heidelberg "to
drive the Prussians," as he announced,
"into the Rhine," and effect a junction
with Sznayda's corps in the
neighbourhood of Carlsruhe. The
plan was a bold one; but Meiroslawski
ought to have known better
than to attempt its execution with
the undisciplined force he commanded.
He, however, appears to have
entertained no doubt of the result;
for the commissariat, baggage, and
even the military chest were sent forward,
he himself following in a
carriage and four.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 21st the
action commenced, and Meiroslawski
found to his cost that six thousand well-disciplined
Prussians were more than
a match for his whole army. At ten
o'clock on the same morning a proclamation
was issued at Heidelberg
by Struve, stating "that the Prussians
were beaten on all points, that their
retreat to the Rhine was cut off, and
that ten thousand prisoners would be
sent to Heidelberg in the evening. The
loss on the side of the "Army of
Freedom" was eight slightly hurt, and
two severely wounded&mdash;no killed!"</p>

<p>In spite of the obvious absurdity of
this proclamation, most of the townspeople
believed it; and it was not till
two o'clock in the afternoon that their
eyes were opened to the deception
practised on them, by the arrival of
between thirty and forty cart-loads of
wounded insurgents. Before nightfall,
upwards of three hundred suffering
wretches filled the hospitals. Crowds
of fugitives flocked into the town, and
every appearance of discipline was at
an end. It seems that, on the approach
of the enemy, the Prussian advanced
guard, composed of one battalion only,
retired till they drew the insurgents
into the very centre of their line,
which lay concealed in the neighbourhood
of Wagheusel. This movement
was interpreted into a flight by Meiroslawski;
a halt was called; and whilst
he was refreshing himself at a roadside
inn, and his troops were in imagination
swallowing dozens of Prussians
with every fresh glass of beer,
they suddenly found themselves almost
surrounded by the royal forces.
At the very first volley fired by the
Prussians, many of the Baden heroes
threw down their arms, and took to
their heels; the artillery and baggage
waggons, which were most unaccountably
in advance, faced about, and
drove through the ranks at full speed,
overthrowing and crushing whole
companies of insurgents. The panic
soon became general: dragoons, infantry,
baggage-waggons, and artillery,
got mingled together in the most
inextricable confusion, and those who
could, fled to the woods for safety.
The approach of night prevented the
Prince of Prussia from following up
his victory, but he established his
headquarters at Langenbruken, within
nine miles of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst the hopes of the insurgents
received a deathblow in this quarter,
General Peucker had pushed with his
division through the Odenwald, and,
after some insignificant skirmishing
at Hirschhorn, crossed the Neckar in
the vicinity of Zwingenberg, with the
intention of advancing on Sinsheim,
and cutting off the retreat of the rebels
in that direction. Von Gr&ouml;ben,
who, on account of the bridges at Ladenburg,
Mannheim, and Heidelberg,
being undermined, was unwilling to
cross the Neckar, sent a small reconnoitring
party over the hills, and, to
the great consternation of the inhabitants,
the Prussians suddenly made
their appearance on the heights above
the village of Neuenheim, thus commanding
the town of Heidelberg.
Four hundred of the foreign legion
immediately sallied over the bridge,
and, posting themselves in some houses
on that side of the river, kept up a
desperate firing, though the enemy
were too far above their heads for
their bullets to take effect. The Prussians
for some time looked on with
indifference, but, before retiring, they
gave the insurgents a taste of what
their newly-invented<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> <i>zund-nadel</i>
muskets could accomplish. Out of
four shots fired, at a distance of full
fifteen hundred yards, two took effect;
the one killing an insurgent on the
bridge, and the other wounding one of
the free corps in the town.</p>

<p>To return to Meiroslawski's army.
After those who had been fortunate
enough to reach Heidelberg had taken
a few hours' rest and refreshment, the
entire mass moved off in the direction
of Sinsheim, their only hope of escape
being to pass that town before the
arrival of General Peucker's division.
Thousands had thrown away their
arms and fled; and most of the soldiers,
anxious to escape another collision
with the Prussians, threw off their
uniforms and concealed themselves in
the woods. One-half of the rebels
were disbanded, or had been taken
prisoners; and Meiroslawski, with the
remnant, made all speed to quit the
town. Every horse in the neighbourhood
was put into requisition to aid
them in their flight, and the whole
gang of civil authorities, headed by
Struve and his wife in a carriage,
(well filled with plunder,) followed the
great body of fugitives. The intrenchments
at Ladenburg, &amp;c., were abandoned,
and by 7 o'clock on the evening
of the 22d, the town of Heidelberg
was once more left to the peaceable
possession of its terrified inhabitants.
The foreign legion, composed of Poles,
Italians, Swiss, French&mdash;in short, the
refuse of all nations&mdash;were the last to
leave; nor did they do so, till they
had helped themselves to whatever
they could conveniently carry off:
indeed, the near vicinity of the Prussians
alone prevented the complete
plunder of the town. During the
night, the better disposed citizens removed
the powder that undermined
the bridge, and a deputation was sent
to inform General von Gr&ouml;ben that he
could advance without impediment.
At 4 o'clock on the morning of the
23d, to the great joy of every respectable
inhabitant of Heidelberg, he made
his entry into the town. Mannheim
had also been taken possession of
without firing a shot, and the communication
between the first and second
divisions of the royal army was
now open.</p>

<p>After leaving Heidelberg, Meiroslawski
succeeded in once more uniting
about fifteen thousand of the fugitives
under his banner. General Peucker's
attempt to intercept him at Sinsheim
had failed, the insurgent general having
reached it two hours before him.
Taking to the hills, he got out in rear
of the Prince of Prussia's division,
and joined his force to that of Sznayda,
which was before Carlsruhe. Robbery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>and plunder marked the entire line of
march. Wine and provisions that
could not be carried off, were wantonly
destroyed, and the inhabitants of
the villages traversed by this undisciplined
horde, will long have reason
to remember the passage of the self-styled
"Army of Freedom."</p>

<p>At Upsdal, Durlach, and Bruchsal,
the rebels made a more energetic resistance
than they had yet done; and
it was not without a hard struggle, and
great loss on both sides, that the
Prince of Prussia, at the head of the
three divisions off his army, (now united,
and numbering upwards of forty
thousand men,) entered Carlsruhe on
the 25th of June. On the approach
of the Prussians, the provisional government,
the members of the chamber,
and the civil authorities of every description,
having emptied the treasury,
and carried off all the public money
on which they could lay their hands,
made their escape to join the remains
of the Rump parliament, who, since
they had been kicked out of W&uuml;rtemberg,
had established themselves at
Freiburg.</p>

<p>After a rest of two days in the
capital of Baden, the Prussian army
was again put in motion to attack the
insurgents, now strongly intrenched
along the valley of the Murg, the
narrowest part of the duchy. Owing
to the numerous and well-served artillery
of the insurgents, it was not
without severe fighting, and great
sacrifice of life, that they were driven
from their positions. Another disorderly
flight succeeded; and by the
30th of the month, the Prussians
were in quiet possession of Baden-Baden,
Oos, Offenburg, and Kebl,
besides having completely surrounded
Rastadt, and cut off every hope of
retreat from that fortress. The remainder
of Meiroslawski's force was
entirely dispersed, the greater number
being captured, or escaping in
small parties into France or Switzerland.
A few hundreds only remained
in Freiburg, under the command
of Sigel. Meiroslawski took
refuge in Basle, having held the command
of the Baden forces exactly
three weeks; and Brentano, after
having remained just long enough to
be abused and threatened by his own
party, made his escape with most of
the other revolutionary leaders into
Switzerland, from which he issued the
following justification of his conduct.
As the document contains a tolerably
faithful sketch of the revolution, with
the opinion of one who may certainly
be considered as an unprejudiced
judge, we give it in full:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">To the People of Baden.</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fellow-citizens! Before leaving the
town of Freiburg and the duchy of Baden,
on the night of the 28th June, I informed
the president of the constitutional assembly
that it was my intention to justify my
conduct towards the people of Baden, but
not towards an assembly that had treated
me with outrage. If I did not do this at
the time I left the country for which I
have acted all through with a clear conscience,
and from which I was driven by
a tyrannical and selfish party, it was
because I wished to see what this party
would say against the absent. To-day I
have seen their accusation, and no longer
delay my defence, in order that you may
judge whether I have merited the title of
traitor; or whether the people's cause&mdash;the
cause of freedom, for which your sons,
your brothers, have bled&mdash;can prosper in
the hands of men who only seek to hide
personal cowardice by barbarity, mental
incapacity by lies, and low selfishness by
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens! Since the month of
February I have strained every nerve in
the cause of freedom. Since the month
of February, I have sacrificed my own
affairs to the defence of persecuted republicans.
I have willingly stood up for all
who claimed my assistance; and let any say
if I have been reimbursed one kreutzer of
the hundreds I have expended. Fellow-citizens!
I am loath to call to mind the
sacrifices I have made; but a handful of
men are shameless enough to call me
traitor; a handful of men, partly those
in whose defence I disinterestedly strained
every nerve, would have me brought
to 'well-deserved punishment:' these
men, whose sole merit consists in tending
to bring discredit on freedom's cause,
through their incapacity, barbarity, and
terrorism; and whose unheard-of extravagance
has brought us to the brink of
ruin.</p>

<p>"I did not return home after Fickler's
trial. The exertion I had used in his defence
had injured my health, and I went
for medical advice to Baden-Baden. On
the 14th of May, I was fetched from my
bed; but, in spite of bodily weakness, I was
unwilling to remain behind. I wished to
see the cause of freedom free from all dirty
machinations, I wished to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
holy cause from falling into disrepute
through disgraceful traffic; I wished to
keep order, and to protect life and property.
For some time I was enabled to
effect this: I endeavoured to prevent
injustice of all kinds, and in every place,
and whenever I was called on; I strove
to protect the innocent against force,
and to prove that even the complete overthrow
of the government could be accomplished
without allowing anarchy to reign
in its stead.</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens! However my conduct
as a revolutionist may be judged, I
have a clear conscience. Not a deed of
injustice can be laid to my door: not a
kreutzer of your money have I allowed to
be squandered, not a heller has gone into
my pocket! But this I must say, you
will be astonished, if ever you see the accounts,
to find how your money has been
wasted, and how few there were who
sacrificed anything to the holy cause of
the people, and how many took care to
be well paid out of the national coffers
for every service rendered.</p>

<p>"No sooner had the revolution broken
out than hundreds of adventurers swarmed
into the land, with boasts of having suffered
in freedom's cause: they claimed
their reward in hard cash from your
coffers. There was no crossing the streets
of Carlsruhe for the crowds of uniformed,
sabre-carrying clerks; and whilst this
herd of idlers revelled on your money,
your half-famished sons were exposing
their breasts to the bullets of the enemy
in freedom's cause. But whoever set
himself to oppose this order of things
was proclaimed to be a mean and narrow-minded
citizen; whoever showed a disinclination
to persecute his political adversary
<i>&agrave; la Windischgratz</i>, was a <i>r&eacute;actionnaire</i>
or a traitor.</p>

<p>"At the head of this party was Struve,
the man whose part I took before the tribunal
at Freiburg&mdash;not as a legal adviser,
but as a friend; the man whose absurd
plan for giving the ministers salaries of
six thousand florins; of sending ambassadors
to Rome and Venice, and agents to
St. Petersburg and Hungary, I overruled;
the man whose endeavour to give every
situation to which a good salary was attached
to foreign adventurers, was effectually
opposed by me. This man, despised for
his personal cowardice, whose dismissal
from the provisional government was demanded
by the entire army&mdash;this man, instead
of supporting and strengthening the
government as he promised, tried, because
his ambitious views found no encouragement,
and with the assistance of foreign
adventurers, to overthrow me; and when
I showed him the force that was drawn up
ready to oppose him, he took refuge in
base lies, and had not even sufficient
courage to go home, till I, whom he had
just tried to overthrow, protected him
with my own body to his house.</p>

<p>"The people had chosen between us, for
at the elections he had been first thrown
out, and he only obtained three thousand
votes as a substitute, whilst I had been
elected by seven thousand voices.</p>

<p>"I had placed all my hopes in the Constitutional
Assembly. I thought that men
elected by the free choice of the people
would duly support my honest endeavours.
I was mistaken. An assembly,
the majority of whose members were
mere ranters, totally incapable of fulfilling
the task imposed on them, and
who sought to conceal their ignorance
by proposing revolutionary measures&mdash;which
were carried one day, to be revoked
as impracticable the next&mdash;was
the result of the election. That I should
prove a thorn in the sides of such men
was clear; and as it was not in their
power to get rid of me, they sought to
make me a powerless tool, by creating a
three-headed dictatorship, with the evident
intention of making use of my name,
whilst holding me in check by the other
two dictators. Although such a situation
might be undignified, still, from love of
the cause, I determined to accept it. I
scarcely ever saw my colleagues in Carlsruhe,
as they found it more agreeable to
run after the army. No reports from the
seat of war ever reached me; and yet the
assembly demanded from me, as being the
only one present, accounts of what I had
received no report of. All responsibility
was thrown on my shoulders. If the
minister of war neglected to supply the
army with arms or ammunition, the fault
was mine; if the minister of finance
wanted money, I was to blame; and if the
army was beaten, my want of energy was
the cause of it!</p>

<p>"Thus was I abandoned at Carlsruhe
in the last most dangerous days, and left
with a set of deputies who, for the most
part, had not even sufficient courage to
sleep in the capital. My co-dictators
found it more convenient to play the easier
part of mock heroes with the army.
Thousands can bear witness that I shrunk
from no work, however trivial; but I can
prove to most of these pot-valiant heroes,
that they put off the most urgent motions
as 'not pressing,' whilst they clung to
others that were of no importance, merely
because they carried them out of all danger
at the national expense.</p>

<p>"In Offenburg we were joined by the
newly-elected member Gustavus Struve,
who immediately demanded my dismissal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
from the government. On being told that
this was impossible, he next wished me
to be taken from the dictatorship, and to
be given one of the minister's places. He
talked of the want of energy displayed by
the government, called it little better than
treason, and tried to learn from my friends
what plans I intended to adopt. He demanded
that the fugitives from the Pfalz
should be placed in office, though, God
knows, we owed them nothing. Indignant
at such conduct, I took no part in the
secret council held at Freiburg, although
I informed several of the deputies of my
intention to resign, unless I received full
satisfaction for the machinations of
Struve.</p>

<p>"The first public meeting of the assembly
took place on the evening of the 28th
June, when Struve brought forward the
following motion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'That every effort at negotiation with
the enemy be considered and punished as
high treason.' Considering what had before
taken place, I could not do less than oppose
the motion, which I did on the grounds
that, as such negotiations could only proceed
from the government, the motion was
tantamount to a vote of want of confidence.
In spite of this declaration on my part,
the motion was carried by twenty-eight
against fifteen votes, and the contest
between Struve and Brentano was decided
in favour of the former. Although some
few of the deputies declared their vote not
to imply want of confidence, the assembly
did not, in that capacity, express such an
opinion. If they did, I call on them to
produce the notes of such a resolution
having been carried; and if they fail to do
so, I brand them with the name of infamous
liars. After this, I did what all
honourable men would have done&mdash;I resigned.
Who, I ask, was to prevent my
doing so; and why am I to be branded
with the name of traitor? I laugh those
fools to scorn who imagine they could
prevent freedom of action in a man who,
having been shamefully ill-used, chose to
withdraw from public life.</p>

<p>"I do not fear inquiry, and demand
from the national assembly that the result
of their investigation be made public, as
it can only terminate in victory for me
and destruction to my adversaries. Why
did this same assembly keep secret the fact
that, on the 28th of June, they decided to
send me a deputation the next morning, in
order to beg I would remain in power&mdash;I
the traitor, I who was to be brought
to 'well-merited punishment!' It was
easy to foresee the personal danger I was
exposed to if I refused, and I therefore
preferred seeking quiet and repose in
Switzerland, to enjoying the rags of freedom
emitted under Struve's dictatorship
in Baden.</p>

<p>"I am to be called to account! My
acts are open to the world. No money
ever came under my superintendence&mdash;this
was taken care of by men who had
been employed in the department for
years. My salary as head of the government
was three florins per day, and I
have paid all travelling expenses out of
my own pocket. But if those are to be
called to account who had charge of the
public money, and became my enemies
because I would not have it squandered,
then, people of Baden! you will open your
eyes with astonishment; then, brave combatants,
you will learn that, whilst you
fasted, others feasted!</p>

<p>"The people of Baden will not be thankful
for a 'Struve government,' but they
will have to support it; and over the
grave of freedom, over the graves of their
children, will they learn to know those who
were their friends and those who only
sought for self-aggrandisement and
tyranny!</p>

<p>"And when the time comes that the
people are in want of me again, my ear
will not be deaf to the call! But I will
never serve a government of tyrants, who
can only keep in power by adopting measures
that we have learned to despise, as
worthy of a Windischgratz or a Wrangel!</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens! I have not entered
into details. I have only drawn a general
sketch, which it will require time to
fill up. Accused of treason by the princes,
accused of treason by the deputies of
Freiburg, I leave you to decide whether
I have merited the title.</p></blockquote>

</p>

<p>At this time of writing, Rastadt still
remains in possession of two or three
thousand insurgents; but, almost without
provisions, and deprived of all
hopes of assistance, the fortress may
be daily expected to surrender. Such
is the termination of an insurrection
of seven weeks' duration, which is calculated
to have cost the country thirty
millions of florins and four thousand
lives. There is no denying that, at
one time, it assumed a most formidable
aspect; and had the people of W&uuml;rtemberg
given it the support its
leaders confidently expected from
them, it might, aided by the discontent
that undoubtedly prevails in
many other parts of Germany, long
have baffled the efforts of Prussia to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
put it down. Yet there are few persons,
even among those who witnessed
the outbreak from its commencement,
who can tell what was the object of
its promoters, unless plunder and personal
aggrandisement be assigned as
their incentives. Their professed motive
was to support the union of Germany
in one empire; but, as the Grand-duke
of Baden had already taken the
oath to obey and defend the constitution
framed at Frankfort, there was
not the slightest pretext for upsetting
his government. It is certain that
the republicans played a most active
part in the affair&mdash;their intention no
doubt being, as soon as they found
themselves victorious under the banner
of the empire, to hoist a democratic flag
of their own. Many who were not
inclined to go so far, joined them upon
doubts of the fair intentions of the
Germanic princes towards their subjects.
Some were perhaps glad of
any sort of change, other turbulent
spirits were anxious for a row, but,
from first to last, none seem to have
had any clearly defined object, or
anything to offer in extenuation of
such waste of blood and treasure.
The next striking circumstance is the
evident incapacity of the chiefs, civil
and military. Throughout the affair,
we do not see one proof of superior
talent, or a single act of daring courage.
The only useful reflection it affords is
one that is perhaps worthy the attention
of the rulers of Germany. Last
year, Struve's attempt to revolutionise
the country was principally supported
by ignorant peasants, mad students,
and a few ultra-liberals and republicans,
and it was in great measure put
down by the soldiers of Baden. This
year, a great proportion of the citizens
in the principal towns were openly in
favour of the movement, and nearly the
whole Baden army joined the revolt.</p>

<h2><a name="LAMARTINES_REVOLUTION_OF_1848" id="LAMARTINES_REVOLUTION_OF_1848">LAMARTINE'S REVOLUTION OF 1848.</a></h2>


<p>So completely was the ordinary
framework of European society broken
up in France by the Revolution
of 1789, that the leaders of every
great political movement, since that
time, have sprung from an entirely
different class of society from what
they were before that event. The old
territorial noblesse no longer appear
as the leaders in action, or the rulers
of thought. The time has gone by
when an Admiral de Coligny, or a
Henry of B&eacute;arn, stood forth as the
chiefs of the Reformed movement;
a Duc d'Orleans no longer heads the
defection of the nobles from the
throne, or a Mirabeau rouse a resistance
to the mandates of the sovereign.
Not only the powers of the
sword, not only the political lead of
the people, but the direction of their
thoughts, has passed from the old nobility.
The confiscation of their property
has destroyed their consequence,
the dispersion of their families ruined
their influence. Neither collectively
nor individually can they now lead
the people. The revolution of 1830,
begun by Thiers and the writers in
the <i>National</i> newspaper, was carried
out by Lafitte the great banker.
That of 1848, springing from the columns
of the <i>R&eacute;forme</i> and the <i>D&eacute;mocratie
Pacifique</i>, soon fell under the
lead of M. Marrast the journalist, and
M. Lamartine the romancer and poet.
And now the latter of these authors
has come forth, not only as the leader
but as the historian of the movement.
Like C&aelig;sar, he appears as the annalist
of his own exploits: like him,
he no doubt flatters himself he can
say, "I came, I saw, I conquered."</p>

<p>The reason is, that mankind cannot
exist even for a day but under the
lead of a few. Self-government is
the dream of the enthusiast, the vision
of the inexperienced: oligarchy is the
history of man. In vain are institutions
popularised, nobles destroyed,
masses elevated, education diffused,
self-government established: all that
will not alter the character of man;
it will not qualify the multitude for
self-direction; it will not obviate that
first of necessities to mankind&mdash;<i>the
necessity of being governed</i>. What is
the first act of every assembly of men
associated together for any purpose,
social, political, or charitable? To
nominate a committee by whom their
common affairs are to be regulated.
What is the first act of that committee?
To nominate a sub-committee
of two or three, in whom the direction
of affairs is practically to be
vested. Begin, if you please, with
universal suffrage: call six millions
of electors to the poll, as in France
at this time, or four millions, as in
America&mdash;the sway of two or three,
ultimately of one, is not the less inevitable.
Not only does the huge mass
ultimately fall under the direction of
one or two leading characters, but
from the very first it is swayed by
their impulsion. The millions repeat
the thoughts of two or three journals,
they elaborate the ideas of two or
three men. What is the origin of the
whole free-trade principles which have
totally altered the policy, and probably
shortened the existence, of the British
empire? The ideas of Adam Smith,
nurtured in the solitude of Kirkaldy.
Would you learn what are the opinions
generally prevalent in the
urban circles in England, in whom
political power is practically vested,
on Wednesday or Thursday? Read
the leading articles of the <i>Times</i> on
Monday or Tuesday. The more men
are educated, the more that instruction
is diffused, the more widely that
journals are read, the more vehement
the political excitement that prevails,
the more is the sway of this oligarchy
established, for the greater is the aptitude
of the general mind to receive the
impulse communicated to it by the
leaders of thought. The nation, in
such circumstances, becomes a vast
electric-machine, which vibrates with
the slightest movement of the central
battery.</p>

<p>Lamartine, as an author, can never
be mentioned without the highest
respect. The impress of genius is to
be seen in all his works: nature has
marked him for one of the leaders of
thought. A mind naturally ardent
and enthusiastic, has been nurtured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
by travel, enriched by reflection,
chastened by suffering. His descriptive
powers are of the very highest
order. We have already done justice,
and not more than justice, to the
extreme beauty of his descriptions of
Oriental scenery.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> They are the
finest in the French, second to none
in the English language. His mind
is essentially poetical. Many of his
effusions in verse are touching and
beautiful, though they do not possess
the exquisite grace and delicate expression
of Beranger. But his prose
is poetry itself: so deeply is his mind
imbued with poetical images&mdash;so sensitive
is his taste to the grand and
the beautiful&mdash;so enthusiastic is his
admiration of the elevated, whether
in nature or art, that he cannot treat
even an ordinary subject without
tinging it with the colours of romance.</p>

<p>From this peculiar texture of Lamartine's
mind arises both the excellences
and defects of his historical
compositions. He has all the romantic
and poetical, but few of the intellectual
qualities of an historian.
Eminently dramatic in his description
of event, powerful in the delineation
of character, elevated in feeling,
generous in sentiment, lofty in speculation&mdash;he
is yet destitute of the
sober judgment and rational views
which are the only solid foundation
for either general utility or durable
fame in historical composition. He
has the conceptions of genius and the
fire of poetry in his narrative, but
little good sense, and still less of
practical acquaintance with mankind.
That is his great defect, and it is a
defect so serious that it will probably,
in the end, deprive his historical works
of the place in general estimation to
which, from the beauty of their composition
and the rich veins of romance
with which they abound, they
are justly entitled. These imaginative
qualities are invaluable additions
to the sterling qualities of truth,
judgment, and trust-worthiness; but
they can never supply their place.
They are the colouring of history;
they give infinite grace to its composition;
they deck it out with all the
charms of light and shade: but they
can never make up for the want of
accurate drawing from nature, and a
faithful delineation of objects as they
really exist in the world around us.
Nay, an undue preponderance of the
imaginative qualities in an historian,
if not accompanied by a scrupulous
regard to truth, tends rather to lessen
the weight due to his narrative, by
inspiring a constant dread that he is
either passing off imaginary scenes
for real events, or colouring reality so
highly that it is little better than fiction.
This is more especially the
case with a writer such as Lamartine,
whose thoughts are so vivid and style
so poetical, that, even when he is
describing events in themselves perfectly
true, his narrative is so embellished
that it assumes the character
of romance, and is distrusted from a
suspicion that it is a mere creation of
the imagination.</p>

<p>In addition to this, there is a capital
deficiency in Lamartine's historical
works, for which no qualities of style
or power of composition, how brilliant
soever, can compensate; and which,
if not supplied in some future editions,
will go far to deprive them of all
credit or authority with future times.
This is the <i>entire want of all authorities
or references</i>, either at the bottom,
of the page or at the end of the work.
In the eight volumes of the <i>History of
the Girondists</i>, and the four on the
<i>Revolution of 1848</i>, now before us,
we do not recollect ever having met
with a single reference or footnote
containing a quotation from any state
paper, speech, or official document.
It is impossible to overestimate the
magnitude of this defect; and it is
astonishing how so able and well-informed
a writer as Lamartine should
have fallen into it. Does he suppose
that the world are to take everything
he says off his hand, without reference
or examination; or imagine that the
brilliant and attractive graces of his
style do not increase the necessity for
such authorities, from the constant
suspicion they beget that they have
been drawn from the store of his
imagination, not the archives of history?
No brilliancy of description,
no richness of colouring, no amount
of dramatic power, can make up for
a want of the one thing needful&mdash;trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>in the <span class="smcap">TRUTH</span> of the narrative.
Observe children: every one knows
how passionately fond they are of
having stories told them, and how
much they prefer them to any of the
ordinary pastimes suited to their
years. How often, however, do you
hear them say, <i>But is it all true?</i> It
is by making them believe that fiction
is the narrative of real event that the
principal interest is communicated to
the story. Where the annals of
event are coloured as Lamartine
knows how to colour them, they become
more attractive than any romance.
The great success of his
<i>History of the Girondists</i>, and of Macaulay's
<i>History of England</i>, is a sufficient
proof of this. But still the
question will recur to men and women,
as well as children&mdash;"But is it
all true?" And truth in his hands
wears so much the air of romance,
that he would do well, by all possible
adjuncts, to convey the impression
that it is in every respect founded in
reality.</p>

<p>There is no work which has been
published in France, of late years,
which has met with anything like the
success which his <i>History of the
Girondists</i> has had. We have heard
that fifty thousand copies of it were
sold in the first year. Beyond all
doubt, it had a material effect in producing
the Revolution of 1848, and
precipitating Louis Philippe from the
throne. It was thus popular, from the
same cause which attracts boys to narratives
of shipwrecks, or crowds to representations
of woe on the theatre&mdash;deep
interest in tragic events. He
represented the heroes of the first
great convulsion in such attractive
colours, that men, and still more
women, were not only fascinated by
the narrative and deeply interested in
the characters, but inspired by a desire
to plunge into similar scenes of excitement
themselves&mdash;just as boys become
sailors from reading terrific tales of
shipwreck, or soldiers, from stories of
perils in the deadly breach. In his
hands, vice equally with virtue, weakness
with resolution, became attractive.
He communicated the deepest
interest to Robespierre himself, who is
the real hero of his story, as Satan is
of the <i>Paradise Lost</i>. He drew no
veil over the weakness, the irresolution,
the personal ambition of the
Girondists, so fatal in their consequences
to the cause of freedom in
France, and through it to that of
liberty over the whole world; but he
contrived to make them interesting
notwithstanding their faults&mdash;nay, in
consequence of those very faults. He
borrowed from romance, where it has
been long understood and successfully
practised, especially in France, the
dangerous secret of making characters
of <i>imperfect goodness</i> the real heroes
of his tale. He knew that none of the
leading characters at Paris were Sir
Charles Grandisons; and he knew that,
if they had been so, their adventures
would have excited, comparatively
speaking, very little interest. But he
knew that many of them were political
Lovelaces; and he knew well that it is
by such characters that in public,
equally as private life, the weakness
of the world is fascinated, and their
feelings enchained. And it is in the
deep interest which his genius has
communicated to really worthless
characters, and the brilliant colours
in which he has clothed the most
sinister and selfish enterprises, that
the real danger of his work consists,
and the secret of the terrible consequences
with which its publication
was followed is to be found.</p>

<p>In truth, however, the real cause of
those terrible consequences lies deeper,
and a fault of a more fundamental
kind than any glossing over the frailties
of historical characters has at
once rendered his work so popular
and its consequences so tremendous.
Rely upon it, truth and reason, all-powerful
and even victorious in the
end, are never a match for sophistry
and passion in the outset. When you
hear of a philosophical historical work
going through half-a-dozen editions
in six months, or selling fifty thousand
copies in a year, you may be sure
that there is a large intermixture of
error, misrepresentation, and one-sidedness
in its composition. The
cause is, that truth and reason are
in general distasteful in the outset to
the human mind; and it is by slow
degrees, and the force of experience
alone, that their ascendency is established.
What attracts, in the first
instance, in thought, independent of
the charms of eloquence and the graces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of composition&mdash;which of course are
indispensable to great success&mdash;is <i>coincidence
with the tendency and aspirations
of general thought</i>. But so prone
to error and delusion is the human
mind, from its inherent character and
original texture, that it is a hundred
to one that general thought at any
one time, especially if it is one of considerable
excitement or vehement
feeling, is founded in error. And
thus it often happens, that the works
which have the most unbounded success
at their first publication, and for
a considerable time after, are precisely
those which contain the largest portion
of error, and are likely, when reduced
into practice, to have the most
fatal effects upon the best interests of
the species. Witness the works of
Rousseau and Voltaire in France, to
whose influence the first revolution is
mainly to be ascribed; those of Lamartine,
Victor Hugo, and Eugene
Sue, who have been chiefly instrumental
in bringing about the still more
widespread convulsions of our times.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of Lamartine's
political philosophy, and
which we regard as his grand error,
and the cause at once of his success in
the outset and his failure in the end, is
the principle of the general innocence
and perfectibility of human nature.
It is this principle, so directly repugnant
to the fundamental doctrines of
Christianity, that it may be regarded
as literally speaking the "banner-cry
of hell," which is at the bottom of the
whole revolutionary maxims; and it
is so flattering to the hopes, and agreeable
to the weakness of human nature,
that it can scarcely ever fail, when
brought forward with earnestness and
enforced by eloquence, to captivate
the great majority of mankind. Rousseau
proclaimed it in the loudest terms
in all his works; it was the great
secret of his success. According to
him, man was born innocent, and with
dispositions only to virtue: all his
vices arose from the absurdity of
the teachers who tortured his youth,
all his sufferings from the tyranny of
the rulers who oppressed his manhood.
Lamartine, taught by the
crimes, persuaded by the sufferings of
the first Revolution, has modified this
principle without abandoning its main
doctrines, and thus succeeded in rendering
it more practically dangerous,
because less repugnant to the common
sense and general experience of
mankind. His principle is, that <i>d&eacute;magogie</i>
is always selfish and dangerous;
<i>d&eacute;mocratie</i> always safe and
elevating. The ascendency of a few
ambitious or worthless leaders precipitates
the masses, when they first
rise against their oppressors, into acts
of violence, which throw a stain upon
the cause of freedom, and often retard
for a season its advance. But that
advance is inevitable: it is only suspended
for a time by the reaction
against bloodshed; and in the progressive
elevation of the millions of
mankind to general intelligence, and
the direction of affairs, he sees the
practical development of the doctrines
of the gospel, and the only secure
foundation for general felicity. He is
no friend to the extreme doctrines of
the Socialists and Communists, and
is a stanch supporter of the rights of
property&mdash;and the most important of
all rights, those of marriage and family.
But he sees in the sway of the
multitude the only real basis of general
happiness, and the only security
against the inroads of selfishness; and
he regards the advances towards this
grand consummation as being certain
and irresistible as the advance of the
tide upon the sand, or the progress from
night to morning. In this way he
hopes to reconcile the grand doctrine
of human perfectibility with the universal
failure of all attempts at its
practical establishment; and continues
to dream of the irresistible and blessed
march of democracy, while recounting
alike the weakness of the Girondists,
and the crimes of the Jacobins&mdash;the
woful result of the Revolution of 1789&mdash;and
the still more rapid and signal
failure of that which convulsed the
world sixty years afterwards.</p>

<p>The simple answer to all these absurdities
and errors, productive of
such disastrous consequences when
reduced into practice, is this&mdash;"The
heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked."&mdash;"There is
none that doeth good, no, not one."
It is from this <i>universal</i> and inevitable
tendency to wickedness, that the
practical impossibility of establishing
democratic institutions, without utter
ruin to the best interests of society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
arises. You seek in vain to escape
from the consequences of this universal
corruption, by committing power to a
multitude of individuals, or extinguishing
the government of a few in
the sway of numbers. The multitude
are themselves as bad by nature as
the few, and, for the discharge of the
political duties with which they are
intrusted, incomparably worse; for,
in their case, numbers annihilate responsibility
without conferring wisdom,
and the contagion of common
opinions inflames passion without
strengthening reason. In the government
of a few, capacity is generally
looked for, because it is felt to be
beneficial by the depositaries of
power; but in that of numbers it is as
commonly rejected, because it excites
general jealousy, without the prospect
of individual benefit. Democratic
communities are ruined, no one knows
how, or by whom. It is impossible
to find any one who is responsible for
whatever is done. The ostensible
leaders are driven forward by an unseen
power, which they are incapable
alike of regulating or withstanding:
the real leaders&mdash;the directors of
thought&mdash;are unseen and irresponsible.
If disasters occur, they ascribe them
to the incapacity of the statesmen at
the head of affairs: they relieve themselves
of responsibility, by alleging,
with truth, the irresistible influence of
an unknown power. No one is trained
to the duties of statesmanship, because
no one knows who is to be a
statesman. Ignorance, presumption,
and ambition, generally mount to the
head of affairs: the wheel of fortune,
or the favour of a multitude incapable
of judging of the subject, determines
everything. The only effectual security
against spoliation by the rulers
of men, the dread of being spoliated
themselves, is lost when these rulers
are men who are not worth spoliating.
Durable interest in the fortunes of the
community is no longer felt, when
durable tenure of power is known to
be impossible. The only motive which
remains is, that of making the most
of a tenure of power which is universally
known to be as short-lived as it
is precarious; and prolonging it as
long as possible, by bending, in every
instance, to the passions or fantasies
of the multitude, nominally vested
with supreme power, really entirely
guided by a few insolvent and ambitious
demagogues&mdash;</p>

<p>Lamartine, regarding the march of
democracy as universal and inevitable,
is noways disconcerted by the uniform
failure of all attempts in old communities
to establish it, or the dreadful
catastrophes to which they have
invariably led. These are merely the
breaking of the waves of the advancing
tide; but the rise of the flood is not
the less progressive and inevitable.
He would do well to consider, however,
whether there is not a limit to
human suffering; whether successive
generations will consent to immolate
themselves and their children for no
other motive than that of advancing
an abstract principle, or vindicating
privileges for the people fatal to their
best interests; and whether resisted
attempts, and failures at the establishment
of republican institutions,
will not, in the end, lead to <i>a lasting</i>
apathy and despair in the public mind.
Certain it is, that this was the fate of
popular institutions in Greece, in
Rome, and modern Italy: all of which
fell under the yoke of servitude, from
a settled conviction, founded on experience,
that anything was preferable to
the tempests of anarchy. Symptoms,
and those too of the most unequivocal
kind, may be observed of a similar
disposition in the great majority, at
least of the rural population, both in
France and England. The election
of Prince Louis Napoleon by four
millions out of six millions of electors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>in the former country&mdash;the quiet despair
with which measures of the most
ruinous kind to general industry are
submitted to in the latter, are so
many proofs of this disposition. The
bayonets of Changarnier, the devastating
measures of free trade and a
restricted currency, are submitted to
in both countries, because anything
is better than shaking the foundations
of government.</p>

<p>In treating of the causes which have
led to the revolution of 1848, Lamartine
imputes a great deal too much, in
our estimation, to individual men or
shades of opinion, and too little to
general causes, and the ruinous effects
of the first great convulsion. He
ascribes it to the personal unpopularity
of M. Guizot, the selfish and corrupt
system of government which the king
had established, and the discontent at
the national risks incurred by France
for the interests only of the Orleans
dynasty, in the Montpensier alliance.
This tendency arises partly from the
constitution of Lamartine's mind,
which is poetical and dramatic rather
than philosophical; and partly from
the disinclination felt by all intelligent
liberal writers to ascribe the failure of
their measures to their natural and
inevitable effects, rather than the
errors or crimes of individual men. In
this respect, doubtless, he is more consistent
and intelligible than M. Thiers,
who, in his <i>History of the French Revolution</i>,
ascribes the whole calamities
which occurred to the <i>inevitable march
of events</i> in such convulsions&mdash;forgetting
that he could not in any other
way so severely condemn his own
principles, and that it is little for the
interest of men to embrace a cause
which, in that view, necessarily and
inevitably leads to ruin. Lamartine,
in running into the opposite extreme,
and ascribing everything to the misconduct
and errors of individual men,
is more consistent, because he saves
the principle. But he is not the less
in error. The general discontent to
which he ascribes so much, the universal
selfishness and corruption which
he justly considers as so alarming,
were themselves the result of previous
events: they were the effects, not the
causes, of political change. And
without disputing the influence, to a
certain extent, of the individual men
to whose agency he ascribes everything,
it may safely be affirmed that
there are four causes of paramount
importance which concurred in bringing
about the late French revolution;
and which will for a very long period,
perhaps for ever, prevent the establishment
of anything like real freedom
in that country.</p>

<p>The first of these is the universal disruption
of all the old bonds of society,
which took place in the first Revolution,
and the general fretting against
all restraint, human or divine, which
arose from the ruin of religion and
confusion of morals which then took
place. These evils have only been
partially remedied by the re-establishment
of the Christian faith over the
whole realm, and the sway which it
has undoubtedly acquired in the rural
districts. The active and energetic
inhabitants of the great towns still
continue influenced by the Revolutionary
passions, the strongest of which is
the thirst for present enjoyment, and
the impatience of any restraint, whether
from the influence of conscience or the
authority of law. This distinctly appears
from the licentious style of the
novels which have now for a quarter
of a century issued from the press of
Paris, and which is in general such
that, though very frequently read in
England, it is very seldom, especially
by women, that this reading is admitted.
The drama, that mirror of
the public mind, is another indication
of the general prevalence of the same
licentious feeling: it is for the most
part such, that few even of the least
tight-laced English ladies can sit out
the representation. The irreligion, or
rather <i>general oblivion of religion</i>,
which commonly prevails in the towns,
is a part, though doubtless a most
important part, of this universal disposition:
Christianity is abjured or
forgotten, not because it is disbelieved,
but because it is disagreeable.
Men do not give themselves the
trouble to inquire whether it is true
or false; they simply give it the go-by,
and pass quietly on the other
side, because it imposes a restraint, to
them insupportable, on their passions.
Dispositions of this sort are the true
feeders of revolution, because they
generate at once its convulsions in
like manner, as passions which re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>quire
gratification, poverty which
demands food, and activity which
pines for employment. Foreign war
or domestic convulsion are the only
alternatives which, in such a state of
society, remain to government. Napoleon
tried the first, and he brought
the Cossacks to Paris; Louis Philippe
strove to become the Napoleon of
peace, but he succeeded only in being
the pioneer of revolution.</p>

<p>The great and durable interests of
society, which the indulgence of such
passions inevitably ruins, are the
barrier which, in ordinary circumstances,
is opposed to these disorders;
and it is this influence which
has so long prevented any serious outbreak
of anarchy in Great Britain.
But the immense extent of the confiscation
of landed property during
the first Revolution, and the total ruin
of commercial and movable wealth,
from the events of the maritime war,
and the effects of the enormous issue
of assignats, has prevented the construction
of this barrier in anything
like sufficient strength to withstand
the forces which pressed against it.
Nine-tenths of the realised wealth of
the country was destroyed during the
convulsion; what remained was for the
most part concentrated in the hands of
a few bankers and moneyed men, who
aimed at cheapening everything, and
depressing industry, in order to augment
the value of their metallic riches.
The influence of the natural leaders of
the producing class, the great proprietors
of land, was at an end, for they
were almost all destroyed. The six millions
of separate landed proprietors,
who had come in their place, had
scarcely any influence in the state; for
the great majority of them were too
poor to pay 200 francs a-year (&pound;8)
direct taxes&mdash;the necessary condition
towards an admission into the electoral
body&mdash;and as individuals they
were in too humble circumstances to
have any influence in the state. The
returns of the "<i>Imp&ocirc;t fonci&egrave;re</i>," or
land-tax, showed that above four millions
of this immense body had properties
varying from &pound;2 to &pound;10 a-year
each&mdash;not more than is enjoyed by an
Irish bogtrotter. In these circumstances,
not only was the steadying
influence of property in general unfelt
in the state, but the property which
did make itself felt was of a disturbing
rather than a pacifying tendency;
for it was that of bankers and money-lenders,
whose interests, being those
of consumers, not producers, went to
support measures calculated to depress
industry rather than elevate it, and
thereby augment rather than diminish
the distress which, from these causes,
soon came to press so severely upon
the urban population.</p>

<p>These causes were the necessary
results of the dreadful waste of property,
and ruin of industry, which had
taken place during the first Revolution.
The multitude of little proprietors
with which France was overspread,
could furnish nothing to the
metropolis but an endless succession
of robust hands to compete with its
industry, and starving mouths to share
its resources. What could the six
millions of French landowners, the
majority of them at the plough, afford
to lay aside for the luxuries of Paris?
Nothing. You might as well expect
the West-End shopkeepers of London
to be sustained by the starving western
Highlanders of Scotland, or the
famished crowds of Irish cottars. The
natural flow of the wealth of the land
to the capital of the kingdom, which
invariably sets in when agricultural
property is unequally distributed, and
a considerable part of it is vested in
the hands of territorial magnates, was
at once stopped when it became divided
among a multitude of persons,
not one of whom could afford to travel
ten miles from home, or to buy anything
but a rustic dress and a blouse
to cover it. At least sixty millions
sterling, out of the eighty millions
which constitute the net territorial
produce of France, was turned aside
from Paris, and spent entirely in the
purchase of the coarsest manufactures
or rude subsistence in the provinces.
The metropolis came to depend mainly
on the expenditure of foreigners, or
of the civil and military employ&eacute;s of
government. This woful defalcation
in its resources occurred at a time, too,
when the influx of needy adventurers
from the country was daily increasing,
from the impossibility of earning a
livelihood, amidst the desperate competition
of its squalid landowners, and
the decline of agriculture, which necessarily
resulted from their inability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
adopt any of its improvements. Thus
the condition of the working classes
in Paris went on getting constantly
worse, during the whole reign of
Louis Philippe; and it was only in
consequence of the vast influx of
foreigners, which the maintenance of
peace and the attractions of the
court occasioned, that they were not
reduced many years before to the
despair and misery which at once
occasioned and followed the last revolution.</p>

<p>Amidst a population excited to discontent
by these causes, another circumstance
has operated with peculiar
force, which we do not recollect
to have seen hitherto noticed in disquisitions
on this subject&mdash;this is the
prodigious number of <i>natural children</i>
and foundlings at Paris. It is well
known that ever since the close of the
first Revolution the number of illegitimate
births in Paris has borne a very
great proportion to the legitimate;
they are generally as 10,000 to 18,000
or 19,000. For a long time past, every
third child seen in the streets of Paris
has been a bastard. Hitherto this important
feature of society has been considered
with reference to the state of
morality in regard to the relation of
the sexes which it indicates; but
attend to its social and political
effects. These bastards do not always
remain children; they grow up to be
men and women. The foundlings of
Paris, already sufficiently numerous,
are swelled by a vast concourse of a
similar class over all France, who
flock, when they have the means of
transport, to the capital as the common
sewer of the commonwealth.
There are at present about 1,050,000
souls in the French metropolis. Suppose
that a third of these are natural
children, there are then 350,000 persons,
most of them foundlings of
illegitimate birth, in that capital.
Taking a fourth of them as capable of
bearing arms, we have 85,000 <i>bastards
constantly ready to fight in
Paris</i>.</p>

<p>Consider only the inevitable results
of such a state of things in an old and
luxurious metropolis, teeming with
indigence, abounding with temptation,
overflowing with stimulants to
the passions. The <i>enfant trouv&eacute;</i> of
Paris, when grown up, becomes a
<i>gamin de Paris</i>, just as naturally and
inevitably as a chrysalis becomes a
butterfly. He has obtained enough
of instruction to enable him to imbibe
temptation, and not enough to enable
him to combat it. He has in general
received the rudiments of education:
he can read the novels of Victor
Hugo, Eugene Sue, and George Sand;
he can study daily the <i>R&eacute;forme</i> or
<i>National</i>, or <i>D&eacute;mocratie Pacifique</i>.
He looks upon political strife as a
game at hazard, in which the winning
party obtain wealth and honour,
mistresses, fortunes, and enjoyments.
As to religion, he has never
heard of it, except as a curious relic
of the olden time, sometimes very
effective on the opera stage; as to
industry, he knows not what it is;
as to self-control, he regards it as
downright folly where self-indulgence
is practicable. The most powerful
restraints on the passions of men&mdash;parents,
children, property&mdash;are to
him unknown. He knows not to
whom he owes his birth; his offspring
are as strange to him as his parents,
for they, like him, are consigned to
the Foundling Hospital: he has nothing
in the world he can call his own,
except a pair of stout arms to aid in
the formation of barricades, and a
dauntless heart ready at any moment
to accept the hazard of death or pleasure.
Hanging midway, as it were,
between the past and the future, he has
inherited nothing from the former
but its vices, he will transmit nothing
to the latter but its passions. Whoever
considers the inevitable results
of eighty or ninety thousand men in
the prime of life actuated by these
dispositions, associating with an equal
number of women of the same class,
affected by the same misfortune in
their birth, and influenced by the same
passions, constantly existing in a state
of indigence and destitution in the
heart of Paris, will have no difficulty in
accounting for the extraordinary difficulty
which, for the last half century,
has been experienced in governing
France, and will probably despair of
ever succeeding in it but by force of
arms.</p>

<p>We hear nothing of these facts from
Lamartine, whose mind is essentially
dramatic, and who represents revolutions,
as he evidently considers them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
as the work of individual men, working
upon the inevitable march of society
towards extreme republican institutions.
He gives us no statistics;
he never refers to general causes,
except the universal progress towards
democracy, which he regards as irresistible.
Least of all is he alive to
the ruinous effects of the first great disruption
of the bonds of society which
naturally followed the Revolution of
1789, or disposed to regard the subsequent
convulsions, as what they really
are&mdash;the inevitable result and just
punishment of the enormous sins of
the Revolution. And&mdash;mark-worthy
circumstance!&mdash;these consequences
are the obvious result of the great
crimes committed in its course; the
confiscation of property which it occasioned,
the overthrow of religion
and morals with which it was attended.
They have fallen with peculiar
severity upon Paris, the centre of
the revolutionary faction, and the focus
from which all its iniquities emanated,
and where the blood of its noblest
victims was shed. And if revolutions
such as we have witnessed or read
of in that country are indeed inevitable,
and part of the mysterious
system of Providence in the regulation
of human affairs, we can regard
them as nothing but a realisation of
that general tendency to evil which is
so clearly foretold in prophecy, and
indications of the advent of those
disastrous times which are to be closed
by the second coming of the Messiah.</p>

<p>We have all heard of the mingled
treachery and irresolution&mdash;treachery
in the national guard, irresolution in
the royal family&mdash;which brought
about the revolution which Lamartine
has so eloquently described. It
is evident, even from his account&mdash;which,
it may be supposed, is not unduly
hostile to the popular side&mdash;that
it was the bar-sinister in its birth
which proved fatal, in the decisive
moment, to the Throne of the Barricades;
and that the revolution might
with ease have been suppressed, if
any other power had been called to
combat it but that which owed its
existence to a similar convulsion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The King was lost in thought, while
the tocsin was sounding, on the means by
which it might yet be possible to calm
the people, and restrain the revolution, in
which he persisted in seeing nothing but
a riot. The abdication of his external-political
system, personified in M. Guizot,
M. Duchatel, and the majority of the
Chambers entirely devoted to his interests,
appeared to him to amount to more
than the renunciation of his crown; it
was the abandonment of his thoughts, of
his wisdom, of the prestige of his infallibility
in the eyes of Europe, of his family,
of his people. To yield a throne to adverse
fortune, is little to a great mind.
To yield his renown and authority to triumphant
adverse opinion and implacable
history, is the most painful effort which
can be required of a man, for it at once
destroys and humbles him. But the King
was not one of those hardy characters
who enjoy, with <i>sang-froid</i>, the destruction
of a people for the gratification of
their pride. He had read much of history,
acted much in troubled times, reflected
much. He could not conceal from
himself, that a dynasty which should reconquer
Paris by means of grape-shot and
bombs would be for ever besieged by the
horror of the people. His field of battle
had always been opinion. It was on it
that he wished to act; he hoped to regain
it by timely concessions. Only, like a
prudent economist, he higgled with opinion
like a Jewish pawnbroker, in the
hopes of purchasing it at the smallest
possible sacrifice of his system and dignity.
He flattered himself he had several
steps of popularity to descend before
quitting the throne."&mdash;(Vol. i., p. 102.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The immediate cause of the overthrow
of the throne, it is well known,
was the fatal order which the delusion
of M. Thiers, when called to the ministry,
extorted from the weakness of
the King, to stop firing&mdash;to cease
resistance&mdash;to succumb to the assailants.
Marshal Bugeaud was perfectly firm;
the troops were steady; ample military
force was at their command;
everything promised decisive success
to vigorous operations. Marshal Bugeaud's
plan was of the simplest but
most efficacious kind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Marshal Bugeaud, with his military
instinct, matured by experience and
the habit of handling troops, knew that
<i>immobility</i> is the ruin of the morale of
soldiers. He changed in a moment the
plan of operations submitted to him. He
instantly called around him the officers
commanding corps. The one was Tiburie
Sebastiani, brother of the marshal of the
same name, a calm and faithful officer; the
other, General Bedeau, whose name, made
illustrious by his exploits in Africa, car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>ried
respect with it, to his companions in
arms in Paris. He ordered them to form
two columns of 3500 men each, and to
advance into the centre of Paris&mdash;the one
by the streets which traverse it from the
Boulevards to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, the
other by streets which cross it from the
quays. Each of the columns had artillery,
and their instructions were to carry,
in their advance, all the barricades, to destroy
these fortresses of the insurrection,
to cannonade the masses, and concentrate
their columns on the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville, the decisive point of the day. General
Lamorici&egrave;re was to command a
reserve of 9000 men, stationed around
the palace."&mdash;(Vol. i., pp. 136, 137.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The despair of the troops when
compelled to retire before a tumultuous
mob&mdash;to confess defeat in
their own capital, and in the face of
Europe, is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At daybreak the two columns of
troops set out on their march; their progress
was, every ten minutes, reported by
staff-officers in disguise. <i>They experienced
no serious resistance on their way to the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville</i>; the crowd opened as
they advanced, with cries of '<i>Vive la
R&eacute;forme!</i>' they trampled under foot,
without firing a shot, the beginnings of
the barricades. Nevertheless, the uncertainty
of what was passing in the Tuileries
paralysed the arms in the hands of the
soldiers. The Marshal, at length constrained
by the reiterated orders of the
King, sent orders to his lieutenants to
make the troops fall back. Marshal Bedeau,
upon this, made his battalions retire.
Some soldiers threw their muskets
on the ground, as a sign of despair or
fraternisation. Their return across Paris
had the appearance of a defection, or of
the advanced guard of the revolution
marching on the Tuileries. The troops,
already vanquished by these orders, took
up their position, <i>untouched but powerless</i>,
on the Place de la Concorde, in the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, in the Rue de Rivoli. The
French troops, when disgraced, are no
longer an army. They felt in their hearts
the bitterness of that retreat; they feel
it still."&mdash;(Vol. i., p. 139.)</p></blockquote>

<p>But it was soon found that these
disgraceful concessions to mob violence
would avail nothing; that M.
Thiers and M. Odillon Barrot were
alike unequal to stemming the torrent
which they had put in motion; and
that the King, as a reward for his
humane order to the troops not to fire
upon the people, was to be called on
to abdicate! In the disgraceful scene
of pusillanimity and weakness which
ensued, we regret to say the princes
of the royal family, and especially the
Duke de Montpensier, evinced as
much cowardice as the princesses did
courage;&mdash;exemplifying thus again
what Napoleon said of the Bourbons
in 1815, that there was only one man
in the family, and that man was a
woman. The decisive moment is thus
described with dramatic power, but,
we have no doubt, historic truth, by
M. Lamartine:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"M. Girardin, in a few brief and sad
words, which abridged minutes and cut
short objections, said to the King with
mournful respect, that changes of ministry
were no longer in season; that the
moment was sweeping away the throne
with the councils, and that there was but
one word suitable to the urgency of the
occasion, and that word was '<i>abdication</i>.'</p>

<p>"The King was in one of those moments
when truths strike without offending.
Nevertheless, he let fall, upon hearing
these words, from his hands the pen with
which he was arranging the names of the
new ministry. He was desirous of discussing
the question. M. Girardin, pitiless
as evidence, pressing as time, would
not even admit of discussion. 'Sire!'
said he, 'the abdication of the king, or
the abdication of the monarchy&mdash;there is
the alternative. Circumstances will not
admit even of a minute to find a third
issue from the straits in which we are
placed.' While he thus spoke, M. Girardin
placed before the King the draft of a
proclamation which he had prepared and
he wished to have printed. That proclamation,
concise as a fact, consisted
only of four lines, calculated to attract
the eyes of the people.</p>

<p>The abdication of the King.</p>

<p>The regency of the Duchess of Orleans.</p>

<p>The dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>A general amnesty.</p>

<p>"The King hesitated. <i>The Duke de
Montpensier his son</i>, carried away, doubtless,
by the energetic expression in the
physiognomy, gesticulations, and words
of M. Girardin, pressed his father with
more vehemence than rank, age, and misfortunes
should have permitted to the
respect of a son. <i>The pen was presented,
and the crown torn from the monarch by
an impatience which could not wait for his
full and free conviction.</i> The rudeness of
fortune towards the King was forgotten <i>in
the precipitance of the council</i>. On the
other hand, blood was beginning to flow,
the throne was gliding away. The lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
even of the King and his family might be
endangered. Everything can be explained
by the solicitude and the tenderness of
the councillors. History should ever
take the version which least humiliates
and bruises least the human heart."&mdash;(Vol.
i., p. 127.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Observe the poetic justice of this
consummation. The member of his
family, who at the decisive moment
failed in his duty, and compelled his
infirm and gray-haired father to abdicate,
was the <span class="smcap">Duc de Montpensier</span>&mdash;the
very prince for whose elevation
he had perilled the English alliance,
violated his plighted word, endangered
the peace of Europe! The
heir-presumptive of the crown of
Spain was the first to shake the crown
of France from his father's head!
Vanquished by his personal fears, unworthy
of his high rank and higher
prospects, a disgrace to his country,
he evinced, what is rare in France in
any station, not merely moral, but
physical pusillanimity. To this end
have the intrigues of the Orleans
family, from Egalit&eacute; downwards, ultimately
tended. They have not only
lost the crown, to win which they
forgot their allegiance and violated
their oaths, but they have lost it with
dishonour and disgrace: they are not
only exiles, but they are despised
exiles. Such have been the fruits of
the Orleans intrigues to gain the
crown of France.</p>

<p>As a bright contrast to this woful
exhibition, we gladly translate M.
Lamartine's account of the memorable
scene in the chambers, where the
Duchess of Orleans nobly contended
with an infuriated and bloodthirsty
rabble for the crown, now devolved
to her son by his grandfather's abdication.
Had such spirited devotion
been found in her husband's family,
they might have transmitted the
honours they had won in the Orleans
dynasty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The great door opposite the tribune,
on a level with the most elevated
benches in the hall, opened; a woman appeared
dressed in mourning: it was the
Duchess of Orleans. Her veil, half raised
on her hat, allowed her countenance to
be seen, bearing the marks of an emotion
and sadness which heightened the interest
of youth and beauty. Her pale cheeks
bore the traces of the tears of the widow,
the anxieties of the mother. No man
could look on those features without emotion.
At their aspect, all resentment
against the monarchy fled from the mind.
The blue eyes of the princess wandered
over the scene, with which she had been
a moment dazzled, as if to implore aid by
her looks. Her slender but elegant form
bowed at the applause which saluted
her. A slight colour&mdash;the dawn of hope
amidst ruin&mdash;of joy amidst sorrow&mdash;suffused
her cheeks. A smile of gratitude
beamed through her tears. She felt herself
surrounded by friends. With one hand
she held the young king, who stumbled
on the steps, with the other the young
Duke of Chartres: infants to whom the
catastrophe which destroyed them was a
subject of amusement. They were both
clothed in short black dresses. A white
shirt-collar was turned over their dresses,
as in the portraits by Vandyke of the children
of Charles I.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Nemours walked beside
the princess, faithful to the memory of his
brother in his nephews; a protector
who would ere long stand in need of
protection himself. The figure of that
prince, ennobled by misfortune, breathed
the courageous but modest satisfaction of
a duty discharged at the hazard of his
life. Some generals in uniform, and
officers of the national guard, followed her
steps. She bowed with timid grace to the
assembly, and sat down motionless at the
foot of the tribune, an innocent accused
person before a tribunal without appeal,
which was about to judge the cause of
royalty. At that moment, that cause was
gained in the eyes and hearts of all."&mdash;(Vol
i. p. 177.)</p></blockquote>

<p>But it was all in vain. The mob
on the outside broke into the assembly.
The national guard, as usual,
failed at the decisive moment, and
royalty was lost.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An unwonted noise was heard at the
door on the left of the tribune. Unknown
persons, <i>national guards</i> with arms
in their hands, common people in their
working-dresses, break open the doors,
overthrow the officers who surround the
tribune, invade the assembly, and, with
loud cries, demand the Duke of Nemours.
Some deputies rose from their
seats to make a rampart with their bodies
around the princess. M. Mauguin calmly
urged them to retire. General Oudinot
addressed them with martial indignation.
Finding words unavailing, he hastily traversed
the crowd to demand the support
of the national guard. He represented to
them the inviolability of the assembly,
and the respect due to a princess and a
woman insulted amidst French bayonets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
The national guards heard him, feigned
to be indignant, but <i>slowly took up their
arms, and ended by doing nothing</i>."&mdash;(Vol.
i. p. 180.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In justice to Lamartine also, we
must give an abstract of his animated
and eloquent account of the most
honourable event in his life, and one
which should cover a multitude of
sins&mdash;the moment when he singly
contended with the maddened rabble
who had triumphed over the throne,
and, by the mere force of moral
courage and eloquent expression, defeated
the Red Republicans, who were
desirous to hoist the <i>drapeau rouge</i>,
the well-known signal of bloodshed
and devastation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In this moment of popular frenzy,
Lamartine succeeded in calming the
people by a sort of patriotic hymn on
their victory&mdash;so sudden, so complete, so
unlooked-for even by the most ardent
friends of liberty. He called God to
witness the admirable humanity and religious
moderation which the people had
hitherto shown alike in the combat and
their triumph. He placed prominently
forward that sublime instinct which, the
evening before, had thrown them, when
still armed, but already disciplined and
obedient, into the arms of a few men
who had submitted themselves to calumny,
exhaustion, and death, for the
safety of all. 'That,' said Lamartine,
'was what the sun beheld yesterday, and
what would he shine upon to-day? He
would behold a people the more furious
that there was no longer any enemies
to combat; distrusting the men whom
but yesterday it had intrusted with the
lead,&mdash;constraining them in their liberty,
insulting them in their dignity, disavowing
their authority, substituting a revolution
of vengeance and punishment for one
of unanimity and fraternity, and commanding
the government to hoist, in
token of concord, the standard of a combat
to the death between the citizens of
the same country! That red flag, which
was sometimes raised as the standard
against our enemies when blood was
flowing, should be furled after the combat,
in token of reconciliation and peace.
I would rather see the black flag which
they hoist sometimes in a besieged town
as a symbol of death, to designate to the
bombs the edifices consecrated to humanity,
and which even the balls of the
enemy respect. Do you wish, then, that
the symbol of your republic should be
more menacing and more sinister than
the colours of a besieged city?' 'No no!'
cried some of the crowd, 'Lamartine is
right: let us not keep that standard, the
symbol of terror, for our citizens.' 'Yes,
yes!' cried others, 'it is ours&mdash;it is that
of the people&mdash;it is that with which we
have conquered. Why should we not
keep, after the conflict, the colours which
we have stained with our blood?'&mdash;'Citizens!'
said Lamartine, after having
exhausted every argument calculated to
affect the imagination of the people,
'you may do violence to the government:
you may command it to change the colours
of the nation and the colours of France.
If you are so ill advised and so obstinate
in error as to impose on it a republic
of party and flag of terror, the government
is as decided as myself to die
rather than dishonour itself by obeying
you: for myself, my hand shall
never sign that decree: I will resist
even to the death that symbol of blood;
and you should repudiate it as well as
I; for the red flag which you bring
us has never gone beyond the Champ de
Mars, dragged red in the blood of the
people in '91 and '93; but the tricolor
flag has made the tour of the world, with
the name, the glory, and the liberty of
our country.' At these words, Lamartine,
interrupted by the unanimous cries
of enthusiasm, fell from the chair which
served for his tribune, into the arms
stretched out on all sides to receive him.
The cause of the new republic was triumphant
over the bloody recollections
which they wished to substitute for it.
The hideous crowd which filled the hall
retired, amidst cries of '<i>Vive Lamartine!&mdash;Vive
le Drapeau Tricolor!</i>'</p>

<p>"The danger, however, was not over.
The crowd which had been carried away
by his words was met by another crowd
which had not hitherto been able to penetrate
into the hall, and which was more
vehement in words and gesticulations.
Menacing expressions, ardent vociferations,
cries of suffocation, threatening
gestures, discharges of firearms on the
stair, tatters of a red flag waved by
naked arms above the sea of heads, rendered
this one of the most frightful scenes
of the Revolution. 'Down with Lamartine!
Death to Lamartine! no Temporising,&mdash;the
Decree, the Decree, or the
Government of Traitors to the lamp-post!'
exclaimed the assailants. These cries
neither caused Lamartine to hesitate, to
retire, nor to turn pale. At the sight of
him the fury of the assailants, instead of
being appeased, increased tenfold. Muskets
were directed at his head, the nearest
brandished bayonets in his face, and a savage
group of twenty, with brutal drunken
visages, charged forward with their heads
down, as if to break through with an
enormous battering-ram the circle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
surrounded him. The foremost appeared
bereft of reason. Naked sabres reached
the head of the orator, whose hand was
slightly wounded. The critical moment
had arrived; nothing was yet decided.
Hazard determined which should
prevail. Lamartine expected momentarily
to be thrown down and trampled under
foot. At that instant one of the populace
sprang from the crowd, a ball discharged
from below grazed his face and stained it
with blood; while it still flowed, he
stretched out his arms to Lamartine&mdash;'Let
me see him, let me touch him,'
cried he, 'let me kiss his hand! Listen
to him, oh, my citizens! follow his councils:
you shall strike me before touching
him. I will die a thousand times
to preserve that good citizen for my
country.' With these words he precipitated
himself into his arms, and held him
convulsively embraced. The people were
moved at this scene; and a hundred
voices again exclaimed '<i>Vive le Gouvernement
Provisoire!&mdash;Vive Lamartine!</i>'"&mdash;(Vol.
i. pp. 393, 402.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We purposely close our account of
Lamartine's personal career with this
splendid passage in his life. His subsequent
conduct, it is well known, has
ill accorded with this beginning. His
popularity in Paris fell as rapidly as
it had risen; and on occasion of the
terrible revolt of June 1848, he retired
from the government, with all
his colleagues, from acknowledged inability
to meet the crisis which had
arisen. We have heard different accounts
of the real causes of his mysterious
alliance with his former opponent,
and the head of the Red
Republicans, M. Ledru Rollin, to
which this fall was owing. Some of
these stories are little to his credit.
We forbear to mention them, lest we
should unwittingly disseminate falsehood
in regard to a man of undoubted
genius and great acquirements. Perhaps,
in some future "Confidences,"
he may be able to explain much
which undoubtedly at present stands
in need of explanation. We gladly
leave this dubious subject, to give a
place to his dramatic account of the
dreadful conflict in June, in the streets
of Paris, which is the more entitled to
credit, as he was an eyewitness of
several of its most terrible scenes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Assemblages of eight or ten thousand
persons were already formed on the Place
of the Pantheon to attack the Luxembourg.
M. Arago harangued them and
persuaded them to disperse; but it was
only to meet again in the quarters adjoining
the Seine, in the Faubourg St
Antoine, and on the Boulevards. At the
sight of them the faubourgs turned out&mdash;the
streets were filled&mdash;the <i>Ateliers
Nationaux</i> turned out their hordes&mdash;the
populace, excited by some chief, began
to raise barricades. These chiefs were,
for the most part, brigadiers of the
national workshops, the pillars of sedition
and of the clubs, irritated at the disbanding
of their corps, the wages of which,
passing through their hands, had been
applied, it is said, to paying the Revolution.
From the barriers of Charenton,
Fontainebleau, and Menilmontant, to the
heart of Paris, the entire capital was in
the hands of a few thousand men. The
<i>rappel</i> called to their standards 200,000
National Guards, ten times sufficient to
overthrow those assemblages of the seditious,
and to destroy their fortifications.
But it must be said, to the disgrace of
that day, and for the instruction of posterity,
that the National Guard at that
decisive moment <i>did not answer in a body
to the appeal of the government</i>. Their
tardiness, their disinclination, their inertness,
left the streets in some quarters open
to sedition. They looked on with calm
eyes on the erection of thousands of barricades,
which they had afterwards to
reconquer with torrents of blood. Soon
the government quitted the Luxembourg
and took refuge in the National Assembly,
where, at the headquarters of General
Cavaignac, was established the supreme
council of the nation.</p>

<p>"Government had reckoned on the
support of the National Guard; but the
incessant beating of the <i>rappel</i> failed in
bringing it forth to its standards. In
several quarters they were imprisoned by
the insurgents. In fine, be it tardiness,
or be it fatality, the army was far from
responding in a body to the imminence and
universality of the peril. Its numerical
weakness aggravated the danger. General
Lamorici&egrave;re, invincible, though soon besieged
by 200,000 men, occupied the whole
extent from the Rue du Temple to the Madeleine,
from the Rue de Clichy to the Louvre&mdash;constantly
on horseback, ever foremost in
fire, he had two horses shot under him&mdash;his
countenance black with powder, his forehead
running down with sweat, his voice
hoarse with giving the word of command,
but his eye serene and calm as a soldier in
his native element, he restored spirit to his
men, confidence to the National Guards.
His reports to government breathed
the intrepidity of his soul, but he made
no concealment of the imminence of the
danger, and the insufficiency of the troops
at his disposal. He painted the immense
multitude of the assailants and the vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
network of barricades which stretched between
the Bastile and the Chateau d'Eau,
between the barriers and the Boulevard.
Incessantly he implored reinforcements,
which the government as continually summoned
to its support by the telegraph, and
officers specially despatched. At length
the National Guards of the neighbourhood
of Paris began to arrive, and, ranging
themselves round the Assembly, furnished
an example to those of the capital. Then,
and not till then, confidence began to be
felt in the midst of the chances of the
combat."&mdash;(Vol. ii., pp. 480-481.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a most fortunate event for
the cause of order, and, with it, of
real freedom throughout the world,
that this great revolt was so completely
suppressed, though at the cost
of a greater number of lives, particularly
in general officers, than fell in
many a bloody battle, by the efforts
of General Cavaignac and his brave
companions in arms. It is said that
their measures, at first, were not skilfully
taken&mdash;that they lost time, and
occasioned unnecessary bloodshed at
the outset, by neglecting to attack the
barricades when they began to be
formed; and certainly the easy and
bloodless suppression of the late revolt
against the government of Prince
Louis Napoleon, by General Changarnier,
seems to favour this opinion.
It must be recollected, however, that
the revolt of May 1849 occurred when
the memory of the popular overthrow
of June 1848 was still fresh in the
minds of the people; and it is not
easy to overestimate the effect of that
decisive defeat in paralysing revolt
on the one side, and adding nerve to
resistance on the other. It is evident
that Louis Napoleon is not a
Duc de Montpensier&mdash;he will not surrender
his authority without a fight.
But supposing that there was some
tardiness in adopting decisive measures
on occasion of the June revolt,
that only makes the lesson more complete,
by demonstrating the inability
of the bravest and most determined
populace to contend with a regular military
force, when the troops are steady
to their duty, and bravely led by their
chiefs. The subsequent suppression of
the revolts in Prague, Vienna, Madrid,
and Rome, have confirmed the same
important truth. Henceforth, it is
evident, the horrors of revolution may
always be averted, when government
is firm, and the military are faithful.</p>

<p>And these horrors are in truth such,
that it becomes evidently the first of
political and social duties for the
rulers of men to justify the eminence
of their rank by their courage, and the
troops to vindicate the trust reposed
in them by their fidelity. Passing by
the woful <i>expos&eacute;</i> of the almost hopeless
state of the French finances, with
a deficit of above <span class="smcap">Twelve Millions</span>
sterling, despite an addition of forty-five
per cent to the direct taxes, made
by Prince Louis Napoleon to the National
Assembly, we rest on the following
curious and important details
taken from the <i>Times</i> of July 12, in
regard to the effect of the revolution
of 1848 upon the comforts and condition
of the labouring classes in
France:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It appears it is the middle class of
tradesmen that are now most suffering
from the effects of revolution. The funds
on which this class had been living, in
the hope that better days would soon
arrive, and which amongst some of the
small tradesmen formed their capital,
have become exhausted. Those who had
no money had, at all events, some credit;
but both money and credit are now gone.
The result is, that even in this period of
comparative tranquillity more shops are
closed than in the days of turbulence.</p>

<p>"The following statement of the fluctuations
of the revenues of the city of
Paris, occasioned also by revolution, and
which goes back to 1826, is taken from
the <i>D&eacute;bats</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The returns of the produce of indirect
impost is the unfailing testimony to
the progress or decrease of public tranquillity.
We proved this truth yesterday
in publishing, on the authority of a well-informed
journal, the comparative state
of the receipts of the Paris <i>octroi</i> for the
first six months of the years 1847, 1848,
and 1849. It is still further proved by
valuable documents which we have at this
moment before us. Thus, the produce of
the <i>octroi</i> was, in 1847, 34,511,389 francs;
and in 1848, only 26,519,627 francs, showing
a difference of 7,991,762 francs. This
decrease is enormous, in relation to the
immense necessities created by the political
and social crisis, the works undertaken
by the city, and the previous expenses
it had to provide for. We could
analyse the different chapters of this
municipal revenue, which affords life to
so many branches of Parisian industry;
but it is useless to inquire, for each of
these chapters, the particular causes of
diminution. With the great event of 1848
before us, all details disappear. One sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
cause has produced a decrease in the receipts,
and that is the revolution of February;
which, at first menacing society
itself by the voice of democratic orators
and the pens of demagogue writers, frightened
away capital and annihilated industry
of all kinds. In order to be able to
judge of the influence of great political
events on the receipts of the Paris <i>octroi</i>,
it will be sufficient to recur to the years
which preceded and followed the revolution
of 1830:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The following from <i>La Patrie</i> gives a
good idea of the effects of an unquiet state
of society:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Revolutions cost dear. They, in the
first place, augment the public expenses
and diminish the general resources. Occasionally
they yield something, but before
gathering in the profits the bill must be
paid. M. Audiganne, <i>chef de bureau</i> at
the department of commerce and agriculture,
has published a curious work on
the industrial crisis brought on by the
revolution of February. M. Audiganne
has examined all branches of manufactures,
and has shown that the crisis affected every
one. In the Nord, at Lisle, cotton-spinning,
which occupied thirty-four considerable
establishments, employing a capital
of 7,000,000f. or 8,000,000f.; and tulle
making, employing 195 looms, were
obliged to reduce their production one-half.
At Turcoing and Roubaix, where cloth and
carpet manufactories occupied 12,000
workmen, the produce went down two-thirds,
and 8000 men were thrown out of
work. In the Pas-de-Calais the fabrication
of lace and cambrics was obliged to stop
before a fall of twenty-five per cent. The
linen factory of Capecure, founded in 1836,
and which employed 1800 men, was in
vain aided by the Municipal Council of
Boulogne and the local banks; it at last
succumbed to the crisis. In the department
of the Somme, 142,000 workmen,
who were employed in the woollen, cotton,
stocking, and velvet manufactories, were
reduced to idleness. In the arrondissement
of Abbeville, where the business,
known by the name of 'lockwork' of
Picardy, yielded an annual produce of
4,000,000f., the orders stopped completely,
and the unfortunate workmen were
obliged to go and beg their bread in the environs.
At Rouen, where the cotton trade
gave an annual produce of more than
250,000,000f., there were the same disasters;
yet the common goods continued
to find purchasers, owing to their low
price. At Caen, the lace manufacture,
which in 1847 employed upwards of 50,000
persons, or one-eighth of the population of
Calvados, was totally paralysed. At St
Quentin, tulle embroidery, which gave a
living to 1500 women, received just as
severe a blow as in March and April,
1848; almost all the workshops were
obliged to close. In the east the loss was
not less considerable. Rheims was obliged
to close its woollen-thread factories during
the months of March, April, and May,
1848. The communal workshop absorbed
in some weeks an extraordinary loan of
430,000f. Fortunately, an order for
1,500,000f. of merinos, from New York,
allowed the interrupted factories to reopen,
and spared the town fresh sacrifices.
The revolutionary tempest penetrated
into Alsace and there swept away two-thirds
of the production. Muhlhausen
stopped for several months the greater
number of its looms, and diminished one-half
the length of labour in the workshops,
which remained open. Lyons also felt all
the horrors of the crisis. In the same
way as muslin and lace, silk found its
consumption stopped. For several months
the unfortunate Lyons' workmen had for
sole subsistence the produce of the colours
and scarfs ordered by the Provisional
Government. At St Etienne and St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Chamond, the principal points of our ribbon
and velvet manufacture, and where 85,000
workmen were employed, the production
went down two-thirds. At Paris M.
Audiganne estimates the loss in what is
called Paris goods at nine-tenths of the
production. The loss on other articles,
he considers, on the contrary, to have been
only two-thirds on the sale, and a little
more than one-half on the amount of the
produce. We only touch in these remarks
on the most striking points of the calculation;
the total loss, according to M.
Audiganne, amounts, for the workmen
alone, to upwards of 300,000,000f.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Such have been the consequences
to the people of listening to the voice
of their demagogues, who impelled
them into the revolution of 1848&mdash;to
the national guards, of hanging back
at the decisive moment, and forgetting
their oaths in the intoxication of
popular enthusiasm.</p>

<p>And if any one supposes that these
effects were only temporary, and that
lasting freedom is to be won for
France by these sacrifices, we recommend
him to consider the present
state of France, a year and a half
after the revolution of 1848, as painted
by one of its ablest supporters,
M. Louis Blanc.</p>


<h3>PROTEST.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"While Paris is in a state of siege,
and when most of the journals which represent
our opinions are by violence condemned
to silence, we believe it to be a
duty owing to our party to convey to it,
if possible, the public expression of our
sentiments.</p>

<p>"It is with profound astonishment that
we see the organs of the counter-revolution
triumph over the events of the 13th
of June.</p>

<p>"Where there has been no contest, how
can there have been a victory?</p>

<p>"What is then proved by the 13th of
June?</p>

<p>"That under the pressure of 100,000
soldiers, Paris is not free in her movements?
We have known this more than
enough.</p>

<p>"Now, as it has always been, the question
is, if by crowding Paris with soldiers
and with cannon, by stifling with violent
hands the liberty of the press, by suppressing
individual freedom, by invading private
domiciles, by substituting the reign
of Terror for that of Reason, by unceasingly
repressing furious despair&mdash;that
which there is wanting a capacity to prevent,
the end will be attained of reanimating
confidence, or re-establishing
credit, of diminishing taxes, of correcting
the vices of the administration, of chasing
away the spectre of the deficit, of developing
industry, of cutting short the disasters
attendant upon unlimited competition,
of suppressing those revolts which
have their source in the deep recesses of
human feeling, of tranquillising resentments,
of calming all hearts? The state
of siege of 1848 has engendered that of
1849. The question is, if the amiable
perspective of Paris in a state of siege
every eight or ten months will restore to
commerce its elastic movements, to the
industrious their markets, and to the
middle classes their repose."&mdash;<i>L. Blanc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It is frequently asked what is to be
the end of all these changes, and under
what form of government are the people
of France ultimately to settle? Difficult
as it is to predict anything with certainty
of a people with whom nothing
seems to be fixed but the disposition to
change, we have no hesitation in stating
our opinion that the future government
of France will be what that of
imperial Rome was, an <span class="smcap">Elective Military
Despotism</span>. In fact, with the
exception of the fifteen years of the
Restoration, when a free constitutional
monarchy was imposed on its inhabitants
by the bayonets of the
Allies, it has ever since the Revolution
of 1789 been nothing else. The Orleans
dynasty has, to all appearance,
expired with a disgrace even greater
than that which attended its birth:
the Bourbons can scarcely expect, in
a country so deeply imbued with the
love of change, to re-establish their
hereditary throne. Popular passion
and national vanity call for that favourite
object in democratic societies&mdash;a
rotation of governors: popular violence
and general suffering will never
fail to re-establish, after a brief period
of anarchy, the empire of the sword.
The successive election of military
despots seems the only popular compromise
between revolutionary passion
and the social necessities of mankind;
and as a similar compromise
took place, after eighty years of bloodshed
and confusion, in the Roman
commonwealth, so, after a similar
period of suffering, it will probably
be repeated, from the influence of the
same cause, in the French nation.</p>

<p>When I speak to you, I mean the <i>bona fide</i> flesh and blood Talboys, sitting

<p>Put up your hands&mdash;so&mdash;my dear Mr North, and frame the picture.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And Maculloch not here! Why the hills behind Cladich, that people call
tame, make a background that no art might meliorate. Cultivation climbs the
green slopes, and overlays the green hill-ridges, while higher up all is rough,
brown, heathery, rocky&mdash;and behind that undulating line, for the first time in
my life, I see the peaks of mountains. From afar they are looking at the
Tents. And far off as they are, the power of that Sycamore Grove connects
them with our Encampment.</p>

<p>Are you sure, sir, they are not clouds?</p>

<p>If clouds, so much the better. If mountains, they deserve to be clouds; and
if clouds, they deserve to be mountains.</p>

<p>The long broad shadow of the Grove tames the white of the Tents&mdash;tones
it&mdash;reduces it into harmony with the surrounding colour&mdash;into keeping with

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Buller, you're a blockhead. Dear Mr Alison, in his charming <i>Essays on
Taste</i>, finds a little fault in what seems to me a great beauty in this, one of
the sweetest passages in Shakspeare.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Sweetest. That's a miss-mollyish word.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ass. One of the sweetest passages in Shakspeare. He finds fault with
the Current kissing the Sedges. "The pleasing personification which we attribute
to a brook is founded upon the faint belief of voluntary motion, and is
immediately checked when the Poet <i>descends</i> to any minute or particular resemblance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Descends!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The word, to my ear, does sound strangely; and though his expression,
"faint belief," is a true and a fine one, yet here the doctrine does not apply.
Nay, here we have a true notion inconsiderately misapplied. Without doubt
Poets of more wit than sensibility do follow on a similitude beyond the suggestion
of the contemplated subject. But the rippling of water against a
sedge suggests a kiss&mdash;is, I believe, a kiss&mdash;liquid, soft, loving, <i>lipped</i>.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Beautiful.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Buller, you are a fellow of fine taste. Compare the whole catalogue of metaphorical
kisses&mdash;admitted and claimable&mdash;and you will find this one of the
most natural of them all. Pilgrimage, in Shakspeare's day, had dropt, in the
speech of our Poets, from its early religious propriety, of seeking a holy place
under a vow, into a roving of the region. See his "Passionate Pilgrim." If
Shakspeare found the word so far generalised, then "wanderer through the
woods," or plains, or through anything else, is the suggestion of the beholding.
The river is more, indeed; being, like the pilgrim, on his way to a
term, and an obliged way&mdash;"the wild ocean."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>The "faint belief of voluntary motion"&mdash;Mr Alison's fine phrase&mdash;is one,
and possibly the grounding incentive to impersonating the "current" here;
but other elements enter in; liquidity&mdash;transparency&mdash;which suggest a spiritual
nature, and Beauty which moves Love.</p>

<p>Ay, and the Poets of that age, in the fresher alacrity of their fancy, had
a justification of comparisons, which do not occur as promptly to us, nor,
when presented to us, delight so much as they would, were our fancy as alive
as theirs. You might suspect <i>a priori</i> Ovid, Cowley, and Dryden, as likely
to be led by indulgence of their ingenuity into passionless similitudes&mdash;and
you may misdoubt even that Shakspeare was in danger of being so run away
with. But let us have clear and unequivocal instances. This one assuredly
is not of the number. It is exquisite.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Mr Alison, I presume to think, sir, should either have quoted the whole
speech, or kept the whole in view, when animadverting on those two lines
about the kissing Pilgrim. Julia, a Lady of Verona, beloved by Proteus, is
only half-done&mdash;and now she comes&mdash;to herself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The language of Shakspeare's Ladies is not the language we hear in real
life. I wish it were. Real life would then be delightful indeed. Julia is
privileged to be poetical far beyond the usage of the very best circles&mdash;far
beyond that of any mortal creatures. For the God Shakspeare has made
her and all her kin poetical&mdash;and if you object to any of the lines, you must
object to them all. Eminently beautiful, sir, they are; and their beauty lies
in the passionate, imaginative spirit that pervades the whole, and sustains
the Similitude throughout, without a moment's flagging of the fancy, without a
moment's departure from the truthfulness of the heart.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is indeed. If we would know the magnitude of the dominion which the
disposition constraining us to impersonate has exercised over the human
mind, we should have to go back unto those ages of the world when it exerted
itself, uncontrolled by philosophy, and in obedience to religious impulses&mdash;when
Impersonations of Natural Objects and Powers, of Moral Powers and
of Notions entertained by the Understanding, filled the Temples of the Nations
with visible Deities, and were worshipped with altars and incense, hymns
and sacrifices.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Was ever before such disquisition begotten by&mdash;an imaginary kiss among
the Sedges!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Hold your tongue, Buller. But if you would see how hard this dominion
is to eradicate, look to the most civilised and enlightened times, when severe
Truth has to the utmost cleansed the Understanding of illusion&mdash;and observe
how tenaciously these imaginary Beings, endowed with imaginary life, hold
their place in our Sculpture, Painting, and Poetry, and Eloquence&mdash;nay, in
our common and quiet speech.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>It is all full of them. The most prosaic of prosers uses poetical language
without knowing it&mdash;and Poets without knowing to what extent and
degree.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay, Seward, and were we to expatiate in the walks of the profounder
emotions, we should sometimes be startled by the sudden apparitions of boldly
impersonated Thoughts, upon occasions that did not seem to promise them&mdash;where
you might have thought that interests of overwhelming moment would
have effectually banished the play of imagination.</p>

<p>Not one&mdash;but the house appointed for all living. A Burial-place. I see
it&mdash;but not one of you&mdash;for it is little noticeable, and seldom used&mdash;on an
average, one funeral in the year. Forty years ago I stepped into a small
snuff-shop in the Saltmarket, Glasgow, to replenish my shell&mdash;and found my
friend was from Lochawe-side. I asked him if he often revisited his native
shore, and he answered&mdash;seldom, and had not for a long time&mdash;but that though
his lot did not allow him to live there, he hoped to be buried in Inishail. We
struck up a friendship&mdash;his snuff was good, and so was his whisky, for it was
unexcised. A few years ago, trolling for Feroces, I met a boat with a
coffin, and in it the body of the old tobacconist.</p>

<p>Then the&mdash;Grayishness.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>The what, sir?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The Grayishness. The exquisite scholarship, and the high artifice of the
words and music&mdash;yet all in perfect adaptation to the scene and its essential
character. Is there not in that union and communion of the solemn-profound,
and the delicate-exquisite, something Cathedral-like? Which has
the awe and infinitude of Deity and Eternity, and the prostrations and
aspirations of adoration for its basis&mdash;expressed in the general structure
and forms; and all this meeting and blent into the minute and fine elaboration
of the ornaments? Like the odours that steal and creep on the
soft, moist, evening air, whilst the dim hush of the Universal Temple
dilates and elates. The least and the greatest in one. Why not? Is not that
spiritual&mdash;angelical&mdash;divine! The least is not too exiguous for apprehension&mdash;the
amplest exceeds not comprehension&mdash;and their united power is felt when
not understood. I speak, Seward, of that which might be suggested for a
primary fault in the Elegy&mdash;the contrast of the most artful, scholarly style,
and the simple, rude, lowly, homely matter. But you shall see that every
fancy seizes, and every memory holds especially those verses and wordings
which bring out this contrast&mdash;that richest line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The breezy call of incense-breathing morn!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is felt to be soon followed well by that simplest&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed"&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>where&mdash;I take "lowly" to imply low in earth&mdash;humbly turfed or flowered&mdash;and
of the lowly.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>And so, sir, the pomp of a Cathedral is described, though a village Church
alone is in presence. So Milton, Cromwell, and other great powers are set
in array&mdash;that which these were not, against that which those were.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Yet hear Dr Thomas Brown&mdash;an acute metaphysician&mdash;but an obtuse critic&mdash;and
no Poet at all. "The two images in this stanza ('Full many a gem,'
&amp;c.,) certainly produce very different degrees of poetical delight. That which
is borrowed from the rose blooming in solitude pleases in a very high degree,
both as it contains a just and beautiful similitude, and still more as the similitude
is one of the most likely to have arisen in such a situation. But the simile in
the two first lines of the stanza, though it may perhaps philosophically be as
just, has no other charm, and strikes us immediately as not the natural suggestion
of such a moment and such a scene. To a person moralising amid a
simple Churchyard, there is perhaps no object that would not sooner have
occurred than this piece of minute jewellery&mdash;'a gem of purest ray serene,
in the unfathomed caves of ocean.'"</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>A person moralising! He forgot that person was Thomas Gray. And he
never knew what you have told us now.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Why, my dear Seward, the Gem is the recognised most intense expression,
from the natural world, of worth&mdash;inestimable priceless price&mdash;dependent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
rarity and beauty. The Flower is a like intense expression, from the same
world, of the power to call forth love. The first image is <i>felt</i> by every
reader to be high, and <i>exalting</i> its object; the second to be tender, and
openly <i>pathetic</i>. Of course it moves more, and of course it comes last. The
Poet has just before spoken of Milton and Cromwell&mdash;of bards and kings&mdash;and
history with all her wealth. Is the transition violent from these
objects to Gems? He is moved by, but he is not bound to, the scene and
time. His own thoughts emancipate. Brown seems utterly to have forgotten
that the Poet himself is the Dramatic person of the Monologue. Shall he be
restricted from using the richness and splendour of his own thoughts? That
one stanza sums up the two or three preceding&mdash;and is perfectly attuned to
the reigning mood, temper, or pathos.</p>

<p>Be it so. But you will not be displeased with me for quoting now, from
heart-memory, a single sentence on the great line, from Beattie, and from
Adam Fergusson. "It presents to the imagination a wide plain, where
several roads appear, crowded with glittering multitudes, and issuing from
different quarters, but drawing nearer and nearer as they advance, till they
terminate in the dark and narrow house, where all their glories enter in
succession, and disappear for ever."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir. That is Beattie?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is. Fergusson's memorable words are&mdash;"If from this we are disposed
to collect any inference adverse to the pursuits of glory, it may be asked
whither do the paths of ignominy lead? If to the grave also, then our choice
of a life remains to be made on the grounds of its intrinsic value, without
regard to an end which is common to every station of life we can lead,
whether illustrious or obscure."</p>

<p>Very fine. Who says it? Fergusson&mdash;who was he?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The best of you Englishers are intolerably ignorant about Scotland. Do
you know the Reverend John Mitford?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I do&mdash;and have for him the greatest respect.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>So have I. He is one of our best Editors&mdash;as Pickering is one of our best
Publishers of the Poets. But I am somewhat doubtful of the truthfulness of
his remarks on the opening of the Elegy, in the Appendix to his excellent Life
of Gray. "The Curfew 'toll' is not the appropriate word&mdash;it was not a slow
bell tolling for the dead."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>True enough, not for the dead&mdash;but Gray then felt as if it were for the
dying&mdash;and chose to say so&mdash;the parting day. Was it quick and "merry as a
marriage-bell?" I can't think it&mdash;nor did Milton, "swinging <i>slow</i> with sullen
roar." Gray was Il Penseroso. Prospero calls it the "solemn curfew."
Toll is right.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>But, says my friend Mitford, "there is another error, a confusion of time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
The curfew tolls, and the ploughman returns from work. Now the ploughman
returns two or three hours before the curfew rings; and 'the glimmering
landscape' has 'long ceased to fade' before the curfew. The 'parting day'
is also incorrect; the day had long finished. But if the word Curfew is
taken simply for 'the Evening Bell,' then also is the time incorrect&mdash;and
a <i>knell</i> is not tolled for the parting, but for the parted&mdash;'and leaves the world
to darkness and to me.' 'Now fades the glimmering landscape on the
sight.' Here the incidents, instead of being progressive, fall back, and make
the picture confused and inharmonious; especially as it appears soon after
that it was <i>not</i> dark. For 'the moping owl does to the moon complain.'"</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Pardon me, sir, I cannot venture to answer all that&mdash;but if Mitford be
right, Gray must be very wrong indeed. Let me see&mdash;give us it over again&mdash;sentence
by sentence&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, Mr North, when does the Curfew toll, or ring?&mdash;for hang
me if I remember&mdash;or rather ever knew. And in the second place, when does
the Evening Bell give tongue?&mdash;for hang me if I am much better informed as
to his motions. Yet I should know something of the family of the Bells. Say&mdash;<i>eight</i>
o'clock. Well. It is summer-time, I suppose; for you cannot believe
that so dainty a person in health and habits, as the Poet Gray, would write an
Elegy in a Country churchyard in winter, and well on towards night. True,
that is a way of speaking; he did not write it with his crow-quill, in his neat
hand, on his neat vellum, on the only horizontal tomb-stone. But in the
Churchyard he assumes to sit&mdash;probably under a Plane-tree, for sake of the
congenial Gloom. Season of the year ascertained&mdash;Summer&mdash;time of Curfew&mdash;eight&mdash;then
I can find no fault with the Ploughman. He comes in well&mdash;either
as an image or a man. He must have been an honest, hard-working
fellow, and worth the highest wages going between the years 1745 and 1750.

curfew." Nor is "the parting day incorrect." Nor "has the day long

<p>"'Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight.' Here the incident,

Confused and inharmonious! By no manner of means. Nothing
of the sort. There is no retrogression&mdash;the day has been unwilling to die&mdash;cannot
believe she is dying&mdash;and cannot think 'tis for her the curfew is tolling;
but the Poet feels it is even so; the glimmering and the fading, beautiful
as they are, are sure symptoms&mdash;she is dying into Evening, and Evening will
soon be the dying into Night; but to the Poet's eye how beautiful the transmutations!
Nor knows he that the Moon has arisen, till, at the voice of the nightbird,
he looks up the ivied church-tower, and there she is, whether full, waning,
or crescent, there are not data for the Astronomer to declare.</p>

<p>My friend Mr Mitford says of the line, "No more shall rouse them from

an ambiguity, as to whether the Poet means the bed on which they sleep, or
the grave in which they are laid;" and he adds, "there can be no greater
fault in composition than a doubtful meaning."</p>

<p>There cannot be a more touching beauty. Lowly applies to both. From
their lowly bed in their lowly dwellings among the quick, those joyous sounds
used to awaken them; from their lowly bed in their lowly dwellings among the
dead, those joyous sounds will awaken them never more: but a sound will
awaken them when He comes to judge both the quick and the dead; and for
them there is Christian hope&mdash;from</p>

<p>This stanza&mdash;says Mr Mitford&mdash;"is made up of various pieces inlaid.
'Stubborn glebe' is from Gay; 'drive afield' from Milton; 'sturdy
stroke' from Spenser. Such is too much the system of Gray's composition, and
therefore such the cause of his imperfections. Purity of language, accuracy of
thought, and even similarity of rhyme, all give way to the introduction of
certain poetical expressions; in fact, the beautiful jewel, when brought, does
not fit into the new setting, or socket. Such is the difference between the
flower stuck into the ground and those that grow from it." Talboys?</p>

<p>Not for worlds would I take the word out of any man's mouth.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Gray took "stubborn glebe" from Gay. Why from Gay? It has been
familiar in men's mouths from the introduction of agriculture into this Island.
May not a Saxon gentleman say "drive their teams afield" without charge
of theft from Milton, who said "drove afield." Who first said "Gee-ho,
Dobbin?" Was Spenser the first&mdash;the only man before Milton&mdash;who used
"sturdy stroke?" and has nobody used it since Gray?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>You could give a "sturdy stroke" yourself, Talboys. What's your
weight?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Gray's style is sometimes too composite&mdash;you yourself, sir, would not deny
it is so&mdash;but Mr Mitford's instances here are absurd, and the charge founded on
them false. Gray seldom, if ever&mdash;say never, "<i>sacrifices</i> purity of language,
and accuracy of thought," for the sake of introducing certain poetical expressions.
"All give way" is a gross exaggeration. The beautiful words of
the brethren, with which his loving memory was stored, came up in the hour of
imagination, and took their place among the words as beautiful of his own
congenial inspirations; the flowers he transplanted from poetry "languished
not, grew dim, nor died;" for he had taken them up gently by the roots, and
with some of the old mould adhering to their tendrils, and, true florist as he
was, had prepared for them a richest soil in his own garden, which he held
from nature, and which the sun and the dew of nature nourished, and will
nourish for ever.</p>

<p>That face is not pleasant, sir. Nothing so disfigures a face as envy. Old

<p>"'Pious drops' is from Ovid&mdash;pi&aelig; lachrym&aelig;; 'closing eye' is from Pope&mdash;'voice

honour to Ovid&mdash;for "pious drops" all honour to Gray. "Closing eye" is <i>not</i>
from Pope's Elegy; "voice of nature" is <i>not</i> from the Anthologia, but from
Nature herself; Chaucer's line may have suggested Gray's, but the reader of
Chaucer knows that Gray's has a tender and profound meaning which is
not in Chaucer's at all&mdash;and he knows, too, that Mr Mitford is not a reader
of Chaucer&mdash;for were he, he could not have written "ashes" for "ashen."
There were <i>no</i> quarries&mdash;there is <i>no</i> Mosaic. Mosaic pavement! Worse, if

<p>"From this Stanza," quoth Mitford, "the style of the composition drops

splendid and elaborate diction of the former part." This objection is disposed
of by what I said some minutes ago&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And I have only this farther to say, gentlemen, that though the language is
plainer&mdash;yet it is solemn; nor is it unpoetical&mdash;for the hoary-headed swain
was moved as he spake; the style, if it drop into a lower key, is accordant
with that higher key on which the music was pitched that has not yet left our
hearing. An Elegy is not an Ode&mdash;the close should be mournful as the opening&mdash;with
loftier strain between&mdash;and it is so; and whatever we might have to
say of the Epitaph&mdash;its final lines are "awful"&mdash;as every man must have felt
them to be&mdash;whether thought on in our own lonely night-room&mdash;in the
Churchyard of Grantchester, where it is said Gray mused the Elegy&mdash;or by
that Burial-ground in Inishail&mdash;or here afloat in the joyous sunshine for an

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Alison on Taste.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>You don't say so! I thought you quoted from memory.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>So I did; but I have dog-eared a page or two.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I see no books lying about in the Pavilion&mdash;only Newspapers&mdash;and Magazines&mdash;and
Reviews&mdash;and trash of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Without which, you, my good fellow, could not live a week.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Age! The Age should be ashamed of herself for living
from hand to mouth on Periodical Literature. The old Lady should indeed,
sir. If the Pensive Public conceits herself to be the Thinking World&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Let us help to make her so. I have a decent little Library of some three
hundred select volumes in the Van&mdash;my Plate-chest&mdash;and a few dozens of
choice wines for my friends&mdash;of Champagne, which you, Buller, call small
beer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I retracted and apologised. Is that the key of the Van at your watch-chain?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is. So many hundred people about the Encampment&mdash;sometimes among
them suspicious strangers in paletots in search of the picturesque, and perhaps
the pecuniary&mdash;that it is well to intrust the key to my own body-guard.
It does not weigh an ounce. And <i>that</i> lock is not to be picked by the ghost
of Huffey White.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>But of the volume in hand, sir?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>"In that fine passage in the Second Book of the Georgics," says Mr Alison,
"in which Virgil celebrates the praises of his native country, after these fine
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hic ver assiduum, atque alienis mensibus &aelig;stas;<br /></span>

<p>There is no reader whose enthusiasm is not checked by the cold and prosaic
line which follows,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Adde tot egregias urbes, operumque laborem.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>The tameness and vulgarity of the transition dissipates at once the emotion
we had shared with the Poet, and reduces him, in our opinion, to the level of
a mere describer."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Cold and prosaic line! Tameness and vulgarity! I am struck mute.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Mr Alison distressed himself with "<i>Adde</i>." It is a
word from a merchant's counting-house, reckoning up his gains. And so much
the better. Virgil is making out the balance-sheet of Italy&mdash;he is inventorying
her wealth. Mr Alison would have every word away from reality. Not
so <i>the</i> Poet. Every now and then, they&mdash;the Poets&mdash;amuse themselves with
dipping their pencils into the real, the common, the everyday, the homely.
By so doing they arrest belief, which above everything they desire to hold fast.
I should not wonder if you might catch Spenser at it, even. Shakspeare is
full of it. There is nothing else prosaic in the passage; and if Virgil had
had the bad taste to say "Ecce" instead of "Adde," I suppose no fault would
have been found.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>But what can Mr Alison mean by the charge of tameness and <i>vulgarity</i>?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I have told you, sir.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>You have not, sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I have, sir.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. "Adde" is vulgar! I cannot think so.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The Cities of Italy, and the "operum labor," always have been and are an
admiration. The words "Egregias urbes" suggest the general stateliness
and wealth&mdash;"operumque laborem," the particular buildings&mdash;Temples, Basilicas,
Theatres, and Great Works of the lower Utility. A summary and most
vivid expression of a land possessed by intelligent, civilised, active, spirited,
vigorous, tasteful inhabitants&mdash;also an eminent adorning of the land.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Lucretius says, that in spring the Cities are in flower&mdash;or on flower&mdash;or a
flower&mdash;with children. And Lucan, at the beginning of the <i>Pharsalia</i>,
describes the Ancient or Greek Cities desolate. They were fond and proud
of their "tot egregi&aelig; urbes" as the Modern Italians are&mdash;and with good
reason.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>How judiciously the Critics stop short of the lines that would overthrow
their criterion always! The present case is an extraordinary example. Had
Mr Alison looked to the lines immediately following, he would not have
objected to that One. For</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tot congesta manu pr&aelig;ruptis oppida saxis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluminaque antiquos subter labentia muros"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is very beautiful&mdash;brings the whole under the domain of Poetry, by singular
Picturesqueness, and by gathering the whole past history of Italy up&mdash;fetching
it in with a word&mdash;<i>antiquos</i>.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I can form no conjecture as to the meaning of Mr Alison's objections. He
quotes a few fine lines from the "Praise of Italy," and then one line which
he calls prosaic, and would have us to hold up our hands in wonder at the
lame and impotent conclusion&mdash;at the sudden transformation of Virgil the
poet into Virgil the most prosaic of Prosers. You have said enough already,
sir, to prove that he is in error even on his own showing;&mdash;but how can this
fragmentary&mdash;this piecemeal mode of quotation&mdash;so common among critics of
the lower school, and so unworthy of those of the higher&mdash;have found favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
with Mr Alison, one of the most candid and most enlightened of men? Some
accidental prejudice from mere carelessness&mdash;but, once formed, retained in
spite of the fine and true Taste which, unfettered, would have felt the fallacy,
and vindicated his admired Virgil.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The "Laudes"&mdash;to which the Poet is brought by the preceding bold,
sweeping, winged, and poetical strain about the indigenous vines of Italy&mdash;have
two-fold root&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trees</span> and the glory of <span class="smcap">Lands</span>. Virgil kindles on the
double suggestion&mdash;the trees of Italy compared to the trees of other regions.
They are the trees of primary human service and gladness&mdash;Oil and Wine.
For see at once the deep, sound natural ground in human wants&mdash;the bounty
of Nature&mdash;of Mother Earth&mdash;"whatever Earth, all-bearing Mother,
yields"&mdash;to her human children. That is the gate of entrance; but not
prosaically&mdash;but two gate-posts of a most poetical mythus-fed husbandman.
For we have Jason's fire-mouthed Bulls <i>ploughing</i>, and Cadmus-sown teeth
of the dragon springing up in armed men. Then comes, instead, mild, benign,
Man-loving Italy&mdash;"gravid&aelig; fruges"&mdash;the heavy-eared corn&mdash;or rather big-teeming&mdash;the
juice of Bacchus&mdash;the Olives, and the "broad herds of Cattle."
Note&mdash;ye Virgilians&mdash;the Corn of Book First&mdash;the Oil and Wine of Book
Second&mdash;and the Cattle of Book Third&mdash;for the sustaining Thought&mdash;the
organic life of his Work moves in his heart.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>And the Fourth&mdash;Bees&mdash;honey&mdash;and honey-makers are like Milkers&mdash;in a
way small Milch-cows.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>They are. Once a-foot&mdash;or a-wing&mdash;he hurries and rushes along, all
through the "Laudes." The majestic victim-Bull of the Clitumnus&mdash;the incipient
Spring&mdash;the double Summer&mdash;<i>the absence</i> of all envenomed and deadly
broods&mdash;tigers&mdash;lions&mdash;aconite&mdash;serpents. This is <span class="smcap">Nature's Favour</span>. Then
<i>Man's Works</i>&mdash;cities and forts&mdash;(rock-fortresses)&mdash;the great lakes of Northern
Italy&mdash;showing Man again in their vast edifications. Then Nature in veins
of metals precious or useful&mdash;then Nature in her production of Man&mdash;the
Marsi&mdash;the Sabellian youth&mdash;the Ligurian inured to labour&mdash;and the Volscian
darters&mdash;then single mighty shapes and powers of Man&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans</span>&mdash;the Decii,
the Marii, the Camilli,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scipiadas duros bello, et te, maxime C&aelig;sar."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The King of Men&mdash;the Lord of the Earth&mdash;the pacificator of the distracted
Empire&mdash;which, to a Roman, is as much as to say the World. Then&mdash;hail
Saturnian Land! Mother of Corn! Saturnian, because golden Saturn had
reigned there&mdash;Mother, I suppose the rather because in <i>his</i> time corn sprung
unsown&mdash;<i>sine semine</i>&mdash;She gave it from out of her own loving and cherishing
bosom. <i>To Thee</i>, Italy, sing I my Ascr&aelig;an or Hesiodic song. The Works and
Days&mdash;the Greek Georgics are his avowed prototype&mdash;rude prototype to magnificence&mdash;like
the Arab of the Desert transplanted to rear his empire of
dazzling and picturesque civilisation in the Pyrenean Peninsula.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Take breath, sir. Virgil said well&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Adde tot egregias urbes operumque laborem."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Allow me one other word. Virgil&mdash;in the vivid lines quoted with admiration
by Mr Alison&mdash;lauds his beloved Italy for <i>the absence</i> of wild beasts and
serpents&mdash;and he magnifies the whole race of serpents by his picture of One&mdash;the
Serpent King&mdash;yet with subjects all equal in size to himself in our
imagination. The Serpent is <i>in</i> the Poetry, but he is <i>not in</i> Italy. Is this a
false artifice of composition&mdash;a vain ornament? Oh, no! He describes the
Saturnian Land&mdash;the mother of corn and of men&mdash;bounteous, benign, golden,
maternal Italy. The negation has the plenitude of life, which the fabulous
absence of noxious reptiles has for the sacred Island of Ierne.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Erin-go-bragh!</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sees another vision&mdash;not of what is absent but present; and
then comes the line arraigned and condemned&mdash;followed by lines as great&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Adde tot egregias urbes, operumque laborem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tot congesta manu pr&aelig;ruptis oppida saxis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluminaque antiquos subter labentia muros."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first line grasps in one handful all the mighty, fair, wealthy <span class="smcap">Cities</span> of
Italy&mdash;the second all the rock-cresting <i>Forts</i> of Italy&mdash;from the Alpine head
to the sea-washed foot of the Peninsula. The collective One Thought of the
Human Might and Glory of Italy&mdash;as it appears on the countenance of the Land&mdash;or
visible in its utmost concentration in the girdled Towns and Cities of Men.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>"Adde" then is right, Seward. On that North and you are at one.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Yes, it is right, and any other word would be wrong. <span class="smcap">Adde!</span> Note the
sharpness, Buller, of the significance&mdash;the vivacity of the short open sound.
Fling it out&mdash;ring it out&mdash;sing it out. Look at the very repetition of the
powerful "<span class="smcap">TOT</span>"&mdash;"<i>tot</i> egregias"&mdash;"<i>tot</i> congesta"&mdash;witnessing by one of the
first and commonest rules in the grammar of rhetoric&mdash;whether Virgil speaks
in prose or in fire.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>In fire.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Mr Alison then goes on to say, "that the effect of the following nervous
and beautiful lines, in the conclusion of the same Book, is <i>nearly destroyed</i>
by a similar defect. After these lines,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>We little expect the following <i>spiritless</i> conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Septemque una sibi muro circumdedit arces.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Oh! why does Mr Alison call that line <i>spiritless</i>?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>He gives no reason&mdash;assured by his own dissatisfaction, that he has but to
quote it, and leave it in its own naked impotence.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I hope you do not think it spiritless, sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I think it contains the concentrated essence of spirit and of power. Let
any one think of Rome, piled up in greatness, and grandeur, and glory&mdash;and
a Wall round about&mdash;and in a moment his imagination is filled. What sort
of a Wall? A garden wall to keep out orchard thieves&mdash;or a modern wall of
a French or Italian town to keep out wine and meat, that they may come in
at the gate and pay toll? I trow not. But a Wall against the World armed
and assailing! Remember that Virgil saw Rome&mdash;and that his hearers did&mdash;and
that in his eyes and theirs she was Empress of the inhabited Earth.
She held and called herself such&mdash;it was written in her face and on her forehead.
The visible, tangible splendour and magnificence meant this, or they
meant nothing. The stone and lime said this&mdash;and Virgil's line says it,
sedately and in plain, simple phrase, which yet is a Climax.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>As the dreaded Semiramis was flesh and blood&mdash;corporeal&mdash;made of the four
elements&mdash;yet her soul and her empiry spake out of her&mdash;so spake they from
the Face of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay, Seward&mdash;put these two things together&mdash;the Aspect that speaks Domination
of the World, and the Wall that girds her with strength impregnable&mdash;and
what more could you possibly demand from her Great Poet?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Arx is a Citadel&mdash;we may say an Acropolis. Athens had one Arx&mdash;so had
Corinth. One Arx is enough to one Queenly City. But this Queen, within
her one Wall, has enclosed Seven Arces&mdash;as if she were Seven Queens.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Well said, Seward. The Seven Hills appeared&mdash;and to this day do&mdash;to
characterise the Supremacy of Rome. The Seven-Hilled City! You seem to
have said everything&mdash;the Seven Hills are as a seven-pillared Throne&mdash;and
all that is in one line&mdash;given by Virgil. Delete it&mdash;no not for a thousand gold
crowns.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Not for the Pigot Diamond&mdash;not for the Sea of Light.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Imagine Romulus tracing the circuit on which the walls were to rise of his
little Rome&mdash;the walls ominously lustrated with a brother's blood. War
after war humbles neighbouring town after town, till the seas that bathe, and
the mountains that guard Italy, enclose the confederated Republic. It is a
step&mdash;a beginning. East and West, North and South, flies the Eagle, dipping
its beak in the blood of battle-fields. Where it swoops, there fanning
away the pride, and fame, and freedom of nations, with the wafture of its
wings. Kingdoms and Empires that were, are no more than Provinces; till
the haughty Roman, stretching out the fact to the limits of his ambitious
desires, can with some plausibility deceive himself, and call the edges of the
Earth the boundaries of his unmeasured Dominion.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>"O Italy! Italy! would Thou wert stronger or less beautiful!"&mdash;was the
mournful apostrophe of an Italian Poet, who saw, in the latter ages, his refined
but enervated countrymen trampled under the foot of a more martial
people from far beyond the Alps.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Good Manners giving a vital energy and efficacy to good Laws&mdash;in these
few words, gentlemen, may be comprised the needful constituents of National
Happiness and Prosperity&mdash;the foremost conditions.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Ay&mdash;ay&mdash;sir. For good Laws without good Manners are an empty breath&mdash;whilst
good Manners ask the protecting and preserving succour of good Laws.
But the good Manners are of the first necessity, for they naturally produce
the good Laws.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>What does history show, Talboys, but nations risen up to flourish in wealth,
power, and greatness, that with corrupted and luxurious manners have again
sunk from their pre-eminence; whilst another purer and simpler people has
in turn grown mighty, and taken their room in the world's eye&mdash;some hardy,
simple, frugal race, perhaps, whom the seeming disfavour of nature constrains
to assiduous labour, and who maintain in the lap of their mountains their
independence and their pure and happy homes.</p>

<p>What does Virgil mean, sir, by "Rerum," in the line which Mr Alison
thinks should have concluded the strain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scilicet et rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>"Rerum"&mdash;what does he mean by "Rerum?" Let me perpend. Why,
Seward, the legitimate meaning of Res here is a State&mdash;a Commonwealth.
"The fairest of Powers&mdash;then&mdash;of Polities&mdash;of States."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Is that all the word means here?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Why, methinks we must explain. Observe, then, Seward, that Rome is
the Town, as England the Island. Thus "England has become the fairest
among the Kingdoms of the Earth." This is equivalent, good English; and
the only satisfactory and literal translation of the Latin verse. But here, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Physical and the Political are identified,&mdash;that is, England. England is
the name at once of the Island&mdash;of so much earth limited out on the surface
of the terraqueous globe&mdash;and of what besides? Of the Inhabitants? Yes;
but of the Inhabitants (as the King never dies) perpetuated from generation
to generation. Moreover, of this immortal inhabitation, further made one by
blood and speech, laws, manners, and everything that makes a people. In
short, England, properly the name of the land, is intended to be, at the same
time, the name of the Nation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

he does not mean fogs, and March east winds, and fever and agues.
I love thee&mdash;is to the green fields and the white cliffs, as well as to all that
still survives of the English heart and thought and character. And this absorption,
sir, and compenetration of the two ideas&mdash;land into people, people
into land&mdash;the exposition of which might, in good hands, be made beautiful&mdash;is
a fruitful germ of Patriotism&mdash;an infinite blending of the spiritual and the
corporeal. To Virgil, Rome the City was also Rome the Romans; and, therefore,
sir, those Houses and Palaces, and that Wall, were to him, as those
green fields, and hills, and streams, and towns, and those cliffs are to Us.

<p>I err not unfrequently&mdash;but not now, nor I believe this evening. Horatio,
the Scholar, speaks to the two Danish Soldiers. They have brought him to
be of their watch because he is a Scholar&mdash;and they are none. This relation
of distinction is indeed the ground and life of the Scene.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Therefore I have entreated him, along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With us to watch the minutes of the night;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou art a Scholar&mdash;speak to it, Horatio."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>You know, Talboys, that Scholars were actual Conjurors, in the medi&aelig;val
belief, which has tales enow about Scholars in that capacity. Horatio
comes, then, possessed with an especial Power; he knows how to deal
with Ghosts&mdash;he could lay one, if need were. He is not merely a man of
superior and cultivated intellect, whom intellectual inferiors engage to assist
them in an emergency above their grasp&mdash;but he is the <i>very</i> man for the work.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Have not the Commentators said as much, sir?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;probably&mdash;who? If they have in plenitude, I say it again&mdash;because
I once did not know it&mdash;or think of it&mdash;and I suppose that a great
many persons die believing that the Two resort in the way of general dependence
merely on Horatio.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>I believed, but I shall not die believing so.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Therefore, the scholarship of Horatio, and the non-scholarship of Bernardo
and Marcellus, strikes into the life, soul, essence, ground, foundation, fabric,
and organisation of this First Ghost Scene&mdash;sustain and build the whole
Play.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Eh? Yes. But to the point in hand. The Ghost has come and gone;
and the Scholar addresses his Mates the two Non-Scholars. And show me
the living Scholar who could speak as Horatio spake. Touching the matter
that is in all their minds oppressively, <i>he</i> will transport <i>their</i> minds a flight
suddenly off a thousand years, and a thousand miles or leagues&mdash;their untutored
minds into the Region of History. He will take them to Rome&mdash;"<i>a
little ere</i>"&mdash;and, therefore, before naming Rome, he lifts and he directs their
imagination&mdash;"In the most high and palmy <span class="smcap">State</span>." There had been Four
Great Empires of the World&mdash;and he will by these few words evoke in their
minds the Image of the last and greatest. And now observe with what decision,
as well as with what majesty, the nomination ensues&mdash;<span class="smcap">of Rome</span>.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>I feel it, sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Try, Talboys, to render "State" by any other word, and you will be put
to it. You may analogise. It is for the Republic and City, what Realm or
Kingdom is to us&mdash;at once Place and indwelling Power. "State"&mdash;properly
Republic&mdash;here specifically and pointedly means Reigning City. The Ghosts
walked in the City&mdash;not in the Republic.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>I think I have you, sir&mdash;am not sure.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>You have me&mdash;you are sure. Now suppose that, instead of the solemn,
ceremonious, and stately robes in which Horatio attires the Glorious Rome,
he had said simply, "in Rome," or "at Rome," where then his &#968;&#965;&#967;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#953;&#945;&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
leading of their spirits? Where his own scholar-enthusiasm, and love,
and joy, and wonder? All gone! And where, Talboys, are they who, by
here understanding "state" for "condition"&mdash;which every man alive does&mdash;</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Every man alive?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Yes, you did&mdash;confess you did. Where are they, I ask, who thus oblige
Horatio to introduce his nomination of Rome&mdash;thus nakedly&mdash;and prosaically?
Every hackneyer of this phrase&mdash;<i>state</i>&mdash;as every man alive hackneys
it&mdash;is a nine-fold Murderer. He murders the Phrase&mdash;he murders the Speech&mdash;he
murders Horatio&mdash;he murders the Ghost&mdash;he murders the Scene&mdash;he
murders the Play&mdash;he murders Rome&mdash;he murders Shakspeare&mdash;and he murders
Me.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>I am innocent.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Why, suppose Horatio to mean&mdash;"in the most glorious and victorious <i>condition</i>
of Rome, on the Eve of C&aelig;sar's death, the graves stood tenantless"&mdash;You
ask&mdash;<span class="smcap">Where?</span> See where you have got. A story told with two determinations
of Time, and none of Place! Is that the way that Shakspeare,
the intelligent and intelligible, recites a fact? No. But my explanation shows
the Congruity or Parallelism. "In the <i>most high and palmy</i> State,"&mdash;that
is, City of Rome&mdash;ceremonious determination of Place&mdash;"a little ere the
<i>mightiest</i> Julius fell,"&mdash;ceremonious determination of Time.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>But is not the use of State, sir, for City, bold and singular?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is. For Verse has her own Speech&mdash;though Wordsworth denies it in his
Preface&mdash;and proves it by his Poetry, like his brethren Shakspeare and
Milton. The language of Verse is rapid&mdash;abrept and abrupt. Horatio wants
the notion of Republic; because properly the Republic is high and palmy,
and not the wood, stone, and marble. So he manages an expeditious word
that shall include both, and strike you at once. The word of a Poet strikes
like a flash of lightning&mdash;it penetrates&mdash;it does not stay to be scanned&mdash;"probed,
vexed, and criticised,"&mdash;it illuminates and is gone. But you must
have eyes&mdash;and suffer nobody to shut them. I ask, then&mdash;Can any lawful,
well-behaved Citizen, having weighed all this, and reviewed all these things,
again violate the Poesy of the Avonian Swan, and his own muse-enlightened
intelligence, by lending hand or tongue to the convicted and condemned
<span class="smcap">Vulgarism</span>?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Now, then, and not till now, we Three know the full power of the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scilicet et Rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Septemque una sibi muro circumdedit arces."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Another word anent Virgil. Mr Alison says&mdash;"There is a still more surprising
instance of this fault in one of the most pathetic passages of the whole
Poem, in the description of the disease among the cattle, which concludes the
Third Georgic. The passage is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ecce autem duro fumans sub vomere Taurus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concidit, et mixtum spumis vomit ore cruorem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extremosque ciet gemitus; it tristis arator,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">M&oelig;rentem abjungens fratern&acirc; morte juvencum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atque opere in medio defixa relinquit aratra."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The unhappy image</i> in the second line is less calculated to excite compassion
than disgust, and is singularly ill-suited to the tone of tenderness and delicacy
which the Poet has everywhere else so successfully maintained, in describing
the progress of the loathsome disease." The line here objected to is the life
of the description&mdash;and instead of offence, it is the clenching of the pathos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
First of all, it is that which the Poet always will have and the Critics wont&mdash;the
<i>Necessitated</i>&mdash;the Thing itself&mdash;the Matter in hand. It shapes&mdash;features&mdash;characterises
that particular Murrain. Leave it out&mdash;'the one Ox drops dead
in the furrow, and the Ploughman detaches the other.' It's a great pity, and
very surprising&mdash;but that is <span class="smcap">NO PLAGUE</span>. Suddenly he falls, and blood and
foam gush mixed with his expiring breath. <i>That is a plague.</i> It has terror&mdash;affright&mdash;sensible
horror&mdash;life vitiated, poisoned in its fountains. <i>Vomit</i>&mdash;a
settled word, and one of the foremost, of the reversed, unnatural vital function.
Besides, it is the true and proper word. Besides, it is vivid and picturesque,
being the word of the Mouth. <i>Effundit</i> (which they would prefer)&mdash;(I
do not mean it would stand in the verse) is general&mdash;might be from the
ears. <i>Vomit</i> in itself says mouth. The poor mouth! whose function is to
breathe, and to eat grass, and to caress&mdash;the visible organ of life&mdash;of vivification&mdash;and
now of mortification. Taken from the dominion of the holy powers,
and given up to the dark and nameless destroyer. "<i>Vomit ore cruorem!</i>"
The verse moans and groans for him&mdash;it may have in it a death-rattle. How
much more helpless and hopeless the real picture makes Arator's distress!
Now, "<i>it tristis</i>" comes with effect.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Yes, Virgil, as in duty bound to do, faced the Cattle Plague in all its horrors.
Had he not, he would have been false to Pales, the Goddess of Shepherds&mdash;to
Apollo, who fed the herds of Admetus. So did his Master, Lucretius&mdash;whom
he emulated&mdash;equalled, but not surpassed, in execution of the dismal
but inevitable work. The whole land groaned under the visitation&mdash;nor was it
confined to Cattle&mdash;it seemed as if the brute creation were about to perish.
But his tender heart, near the close, singled out, from the thousands, one yoke
of Steers&mdash;in two lines and a half told the death of one&mdash;in two lines and a
half told the sadness of its owner&mdash;and in as many lines more told, too, of the
survivor sinking, because his brother "was not"&mdash;and in as many more a
lament for the cruel sufferings of the harmless creature&mdash;lines which, Scaliger
says, he would rather have written than have been honoured by the Lydian
or the Persian king.</p>

<p>Well done, Old Buck! This fervour and particularity are admirable. But,
methinks, if I caught the words rightly, that George mistakes the meaning of
&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#969;&#957;&mdash;honorary; he has &#947;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, an <i>old man</i>, singing in his ears; but
old for wine would be quite a different word.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And he makes Agamemnon commend Idomeneus for drinking generously
and honestly, whilst the others are afraid of their cups&mdash;as Claudius, King of
Denmark, might praise one of his strong-headed courtiers, and laugh at
Polonius. Agamemnon does not say that Idomeneus' goblet was <i>not</i> mixed&mdash;was
<i>neat</i>&mdash;rather we use to think that wine was always mixed&mdash;but whether
"with small," as old Chapman says, or with water, I don't know&mdash;but I
fancied water! But perhaps, Seward, the investigation of a Grecian Feast in
heroic time, and in Attic, becomes an exigency. Chapman is at least determined&mdash;and
wisely&mdash;to show that he is not afraid of the matter&mdash;that he saw
nothing in it "altogether inconsistent with the dignity of the speech and the

know&mdash;on the &#7937;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945;&mdash;I think he calls it&mdash;of the Homeric Heroes&mdash;their
waiting on themselves, or their self-sufficiency&mdash;where I think that he collects
the picture.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to say I do not know it.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>No matter. You see how this connects with the scheme of the Poem&mdash;in
which, prevalent or conspicuous by the amplitude of the space which it occupies,
is the individual prowess of heroes in field&mdash;conspicuous, too, by its moment
in action. This is another and loftier mode of the &#7937;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945;. The human bosom
is a seat or fountain of power. Power goes forth, emanates in all directions,
high and low, right and left. The Man is a terrestrial God. He takes counsel
with his own heart, and he acts. "He conversed with his own magnanimous
spirit"&mdash;or as Milton says of Abdiel meeting Satan&mdash;"And thus his
own undaunted heart explored."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr North, the Man is as a terrestrial God; but&mdash;with continual
recognition by the Poet and his heroes&mdash;as under the celestial Gods. And I
apprehend, sir, that this two-fold way of representing man, in himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
towards them, is that which first separates the Homeric from and above all
other Poetry, is its proper element of grandeur, in which we never bathe
without coming out aggrandised.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Seward, you instruct me by&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Oh, no, sir! You instruct me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>We instruct each other. For this the heroes are all Demigods&mdash;that is, the
son of a God, or Goddess, or the Descendant at a few Generations. Sarpedon
is the Son of Jupiter, and his death by Patroclus is perhaps the passage of
the whole Iliad that most specially and energetically, and most profoundly
and pathetically, makes the Gods intimate to the life and being of men&mdash;presents
the conduct of divinity and humanity with condescension there, and for
elevation here. I do not mean that there is not more pomp of glorification about
Achilles, for whom Jupiter comes from Olympus to Ida, and Vulcan forges
arms&mdash;whose Mother-Goddess is Messenger to and from Jupiter, and into
whose lips, when he is faint with toil and want of nourishment&mdash;abstaining in
his passion of sorrow and vengeance&mdash;Minerva, descending, instils Nectar.
But I doubt if there be anything so touching&mdash;<i>under this relation</i>&mdash;and so intimately
aggrandising as that other whole place&mdash;the hesitation of Jupiter whether
he shall <span class="smcap">violate Fate</span>, in order to save his own flesh and blood from its
decreed stroke&mdash;the consolatory device of Juno (in remonstrating and dissuading)
that he shall send Apollo to call Death and Sleep&mdash;a God-Messenger
to God-Ministers&mdash;to bear the dead body from the battle-field to his own land
and kin for due obsequies. And, lastly, those <i>drops of blood</i> which fall from
the sky to the earth, as if the heart-tears of the Sire of all the worlds and
their inhabitants.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>You are always great, sir, on Homer. But, pray, have you any intention
of returning to the &#7937;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945;?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ha! Buller&mdash;do you speak? I have not wandered from it. But since you
seem to think I have, think of Patroclus lighting a fire under a tripod with his
own hands, to boil meat for Achilles' guests&mdash;of Achilles himself helping to lay
the ransomed body of Hector on the car that was to take it away. This last is
honorific and pathetic. Ministrations of all degrees for themselves, in their own
affairs, characterise them all. From the least of these to Achilles fighting the
River-God&mdash;which is an excess&mdash;all holds together&mdash;is of one meaning&mdash;and
here, as everywhere, the least, and the familiar, and most homely, attests,
vouches, makes evident, probable, and facile to credence, the highest, most
uncouth, remote, and difficult otherwise of acceptation. Pitching the speculation
lower, plenitude of the most robust, ardent, vigorous life overflows the
Iliad&mdash;up from the animal to the divine&mdash;from the beautiful tall poplar by the
river-side, which the wheelwright or wainwright fells. Eating, drinking,
sleeping, thrusting through with spears, and hacking the live flesh off the bone&mdash;all
go together and help one another&mdash;and make the "Majesty and Dignity"&mdash;or
what not&mdash;of the Homeric Epos. But I see, Buller, that you are <i>timing
me</i>&mdash;and I am ashamed to confess that I have exceeded the assigned limit.
Gentlemen, I ask all your pardons.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Timing you&mdash;my dear sir! Look&mdash;'tis only my snuff-box&mdash;your own gift&mdash;with
your own haunted Head on the lid&mdash;inspired work of Laurence Macdonald.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Give it me&mdash;why there&mdash;there&mdash;by your own unhappy awkwardness&mdash;it has
gone&mdash;gone&mdash;to the bottom of the deepest part of the Loch!</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I don't care. It <i>was</i> my chronometer! The Box is safe.</p>

<p>And so is the Chronometer. Here it is&mdash;I was laughing at you&mdash;in my sleeve.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Have you any more annotations on Alison?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Many. The flaws are few. I verily believe these are all. To elucidate
his Truths&mdash;in Taste and in Morals&mdash;would require from us Four a far longer
Dialogue. Alison's Essays should be reprinted in one Pocket Volume&mdash;wisdom
and Goodness are in that family hereditary&mdash;the editing would be a Work
of Love&mdash;and in Bohn's Standard Library they would confer benefit on
thousands who now know but their name.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>My dear sir, last time we voyaged the Loch, you said a few words&mdash;perhaps
you may remember it&mdash;about those philosophers&mdash;Alison&mdash;the "Man
of Taste," as Thomas Campbell loved to call him&mdash;assuredly is not of the
number&mdash;who have insisted on the natural Beauty of Virtue, and natural Deformity
of Vice, and have appeared to place our capacity of distinguishing
Right from Wrong chiefly, if not solely, on the sense of this Beauty and of
this Deformity&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I remember saying, my dear Seward, that they have drawn their views
too much from the consideration of the state of these feelings in men who
had been long exercised in the pure speculative contemplation of moral Goodness
and Truth, as well as in the calmness and purity of a tranquil, virtuous
life. Was it so?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>In such minds, when all the calm faculties of the soul are wedded in happy
union to the image of Virtue, there is, I have no doubt, that habitual feeling
for which the term Beauty furnishes a natural and just expression. But I
apprehend that this is not the true expression of that serious and solemn feeling
which accompanies the understanding of the qualities of Moral Action in the
minds of the generality of men. They who in the midst of their own unhappy
perversions, are visited with knowledge of those immutable distinctions,
and they who in the ordinary struggles and trials incident to our condition,
maintain their conduct in unison with their strongly grounded principles and
better aspirations, would seldom, I apprehend, employ this language for the
description of feelings which can hardly be separated, from the ideas of an
awful responsibility involving the happiness and misery of the accountable subjects
of a moral order of Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>You think, sir, that to assign this perception of Beauty and Deformity, as
the groundwork of our Moral Nature, is to rest on too slight a foundation
that part of man's constitution which is first in importance to his welfare?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Assuredly, my dear friend, I do. Nay, I do not fear to say that the
Emotion, which may properly be termed a Feeling of Beauty in Virtue, takes
place at those times when the deepest affection of our souls towards Good
and Evil acts less strongly, and when the Emotion we feel is derived more
from Imagination&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>And may I venture to suggest, sir, that as Imagination, which is so strong a
principle in our minds, will take its temper from any prevalent feelings, and
even from any fixed and permanent habits of mind, so our Feeling of
Beauty and Deformity shall be different to different men, either according to
the predominant strength of natural principles, or according to their course
of life?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Even so. And therefore this general disposition of Imagination to receive
its character will apply, no doubt, where the prevailing feelings and habits
are of a Moral cast; and hence in minds engaged in calm intellectual speculation,
and maintaining their own moral nature rather in innocence and simplicity
of life than in the midst of difficult and trying situations and in conflict with
passions, there can be no doubt that the Imagination will give itself up to this
general Moral Cast of Mind, and feel Beauty and Deformity vividly and uniformly
in the contemplation of the moral quality of actions and moral states
of character.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>But your words imply&mdash;do they not, sir? that such is the temper of their
calmer minds, and not the emotion which is known when, from any great act
of Virtue or Crime, which comes suddenly upon them, their Moral Spirit rises
up in its native strength, to declare its own Affection and its own Judgment?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Just so. Besides, my excellent friend, if you consider well the feeling which
takes possession of us, on contemplating some splendid act of heroic and self-devoting
Virtue, we shall find that the sort of enthusiastic transport which may
kindle towards him who has performed it, is not properly a moral transport
at all; but it is a burst of love and admiration. Take out, then, from any
such emotion, what Imagination, and Love, and Sympathy have supplied, and
leave only what the Moral Spirit recognises of Moral Will in the act, and you
will find that much of that dazzling and splendid Beauty which produced the
transport of loving admiration is removed.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>And if so, sir, then must it be very important that we should not deceive
ourselves, and rely upon the warmth of emotion we may feel towards generous
and heroic actions as evidence of the force of the Moral Principle in our own
breasts, which requires to be ascertained by a very different test&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay, Seward; and it is important also, that we should learn to acknowledge
and to respect, in those who, without the capacity of such vivid feelings, are
yet conscientiously faithful to the known Moral Law, the merit and dignity of
their Moral Obedience. We must allow to Virtue, my dearest Seward, all that
is her due&mdash;her countenance beautiful in its sweet serenity&mdash;her voice gentle
and mild&mdash;her demeanour graceful&mdash;and a simple majesty in the flowing folds
of her stainless raiment. So may we picture her to our imagination, and to our
hearts. But we must beware of making such abstractions fantastic and
visionary, lest we come at last to think of emotions of Virtue and Taste as one
and the same&mdash;a fatal error indeed&mdash;and that would rob human life of much of
its melancholy grandeur. The beauty of Virtue is but the smile on her celestial
countenance&mdash;and may be admired&mdash;loved&mdash;by those who hold but little com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>munion
with her inner heart&mdash;and it may be overlooked by those who pay to
her the most devout worship.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Methinks, sir, that the moral emotion with which we regard actions greatly
right or greatly wrong, is no transport; it is an earnest, solemn feeling of a
mind knowing there is no peace for living souls, except in their Moral Obedience,
and therefore receiving a deep and grateful assurance of the peace of
one soul more, in witnessing its adherence to its virtue; and the pain which
is suffered from crime is much more allied to sorrow, in contemplating the
wilful departure of a spirit from its only possible Good, than to those feelings
of repugnance and hate which characterise the temper of our common human
emotion towards crimes offering violence and outrage to humanity.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I believe that, though darkness lies round and about us seeking to solve
such questions, a feeling of deep satisfaction in witnessing the adherence to
Moral Rectitude, and of deep pain in witnessing the departure from it, are
the necessary results of a moral sensibility; but taken in their elementary
simplicity, they have, I think, a character distinct from those many other
emotions which will necessarily blend with them, in the heart of one human
being looking upon the actions of another&mdash;"because that we have all one
human heart."</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Who can doubt that Religion infuses power and exaltation into the Arts?
The bare History teaches this. In Greece Poetry sang of Gods, and of Heroes,
in whose transactions Gods moved. Sculpture moulded Forms which were
attempted expressions of Divine Attributes. Architecture constructed Temples.
<i>De facto</i> the Grecian Arts rose out of Religion. And were not the
same Arts, of revived Italy, religious?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>They all require for their foundation and support a great pervading sympathy&mdash;some
Feeling that holds a whole national breast. This is needed to
munificently defraying the Costlier Arts&mdash;no base consideration at bottom.
For it is <i>a</i> life-bond of this life, that is freely dropped, when men freely and
generously contribute their means to the honour of Religion. There is a sentiment
in opening your purse.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Yes, Buller&mdash;without that sentiment, no man can love noble Art. The
true, deep, grand support of Genius is the confidence of universal sympathy.
Homer sings because Greece listens. Phidias pours out his soul over marble,
gold, and ivory, because he knows that at Olympia united Greece will wonder
and will worship. Think how Poet is dumb and Sculptor lame, who foreknows
that what he <i>would</i> sing, what he <i>would</i> carve, will neither be felt nor
understood.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>The Religion of a people furnishes the sympathy which both <i>pays and
applauds</i>.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>And Religion affords to the Artist in Words or Forms the highest Norms of
Thought&mdash;sublime, beautiful, solemn&mdash;withal the sense of Aspiration&mdash;possibly
of Inspiration.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And it guards Philosophy&mdash;and preserves it, by spiritual influence, from
degradation worse than death. The mind is first excited into activity through
the impressions made by external objects on the senses. The French metaphysicians&mdash;pretending
to follow Locke&mdash;proceeded to discover in the mind a
mere compound of Sensations, and of Ideas drawn from Sensations. Sensations,
and Ideas that were the Relics of Sensations&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>And thus, sir, by degrees, the Mind appeared to them to be nothing else
than a product of the Body&mdash;say rather a state of the Body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>A self-degradation, my friend, which to the utmost removes the mind from
God. And this Creed was welcome to those to whom the belief in Him
was irksome. That which we see and touch became to such Philosophers the
whole of Reality. Deity&mdash;the Relation of the Creation to the Creator&mdash;the
hope of a Futurity beyond the grave&mdash;vanished from the Belief of Materialists
living in, and by, and to&mdash;Sensation.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>And with what a horrid sympathy was the creed welcomed!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay, Seward, I who lived nearer the time&mdash;perhaps better than you can&mdash;know
the evil. Not in the schools alone, or in the solitude of philosophical
thought, the doctrine of an arid speculation circulated, like a thin and unwholesome
blood, through the veins of polite literature; not in the schools
alone, but in the gorgeous and gay saloons, where the highly-born, the courtly,
and the wealthy, winged the lazy hours with light or dissolute pleasures&mdash;there
the Philosophy which fettered the soul in the pleasing bands of the
Senses, which plucked it back from a feared immortality, which opened a gulf
of infinite separation between it and its Maker, was cordially entertained&mdash;there
it pointed the jest and the jibe. Scepticism a study&mdash;the zeal of Unbelief!
Principles of false thought appeared suddenly and widely as principles
of false passion and of false action. Doubts, difficulties, guesses, fine spinnings
of the perverse brain, seized upon the temper of the times&mdash;became the springs
of public and popular movements&mdash;engines of political change. The Venerations
of Time were changed into Abominations. A Will strong to overthrow&mdash;hostile
to Order&mdash;anarchical&mdash;"intended siege and defiance to Heaven."
The irreligious Philosophy of the calmer time now bore its fruits. The Century
had prepared the explosion that signalised its close&mdash;Impiety was
the name of the Giant whom these throes of the convulsed earth had borne
into the day, and down together went Throne and Altar&mdash;But where are we?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>At the river mouth.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>What! at home.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>See the Tent-Lights&mdash;hear the Tent-Music.</p>

unassisted but by the Crutch.</p>
